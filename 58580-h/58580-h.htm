John L. Stoddard was born in Brookline, Mass., April 24, 1850. He
graduated at Williams College, as valedictorian of his class, in 1871, and
then studied theology for two years at Yale Divinity School. Next he taught
Latin and French in the Boston Latin School. In 1874 he was able to gratify
a long cherished desire to travel in foreign lands, and not only made the
customary tour of Europe, but visited Greece, Asia Minor, Palestine and
Egypt as well. He then studied in Germany, and upon his return to America,
began his career as a lecturer, which for about twenty years has known no
interruptions save those due to his repeated visits to remote countries. His
travels embrace nearly all the habitable parts of the globe.

<h2>
PREFACE
</h2>

<p>
A witty French abbé was once asked why he kept up
a country-seat which he never visited. "Do you
not know," he answered, "that I must have some
place, where, though I never go to it, I can always imagine
that I might be happier than where I am?" The world is
like the abbé. Most of us are not living, we are anticipating
life. We are always "going to our country seats." It is
the land we have not visited that is to give to us our greatest
happiness. If we have not yet found it in America, it is
awaiting us in Europe; if not in Europe, surely in Japan.
As the Germans say, "<span lang='de_DE'>Da wo ich nicht bin, da ist das
Glück.</span>" Hence travel is attractive, if only as a means of
acquiring that happiness which here seems so elusive. All
of us hope to some day visit Europe and the Orient, and
for that reason everything pertaining to their beauty, art,
and history seems alluring. But when these have been seen,
the wished-for goal of the untraveled world again recedes,
and the desire is just as strong to visit other and more distant
lands.
</p>

<p>
This love of travel is not caused by ordinary restlessness.
It springs originally from the universal craving of the soul
for something different from its usual environment.
</p>

<p>
It also comes from a legitimate longing for that broader
education which only personal study of other races, civilizations
and religions can bestow. And, finally, it arises from a
yearning for the joy and benefit of <i>realizing history</i> by visiting
the ancient shrines of art, the homes or sepulchres of
heroes, and the arenas of heroic deeds. When such desires
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_6' name='Page_6' href='#Page_6'>6</a></span>
are once awakened, to travel is to live, to remain continually
in one place is to stagnate.
</p>

<p>
Thousands of books of travel have been written, but notwithstanding
that the scenes described in them are practically
the same, and though the streets and buildings which adorn
their text are perfectly familiar to their readers, such works are
usually welcome, and always in proportion to the degree in
which mere figures and statistics are subordinated to the <i>ideas</i>
suggested by such travel to the writer's mind, which, of course,
vary infinitely according to the culture, sympathy and enthusiasm
of the individual. Thus, in a similar way, the keys of
all pianos are the same; yet it is not the bits of ivory themselves
that hold us spell-bound, but the magnetic fingers that
move over them, and the musical interpretation and expression
given by the performer.
</p>

<p>
If only accurate statistics and detailed descriptions were
desired, guide-books would be sufficient; but who ever reads
a guide-book for amusement?
</p>

<p>
Such thoughts have encouraged the author of these volumes
to present in printed form lectures which for eighteen
years have been received with never-failing kindness by an
indulgent public. <i><span lang="la">Verba volant; Scripta manent</span></i> (Words are
fleeting, but what is written remains). The voice of the
speaker dies away, and what he says is soon forgotten, but on
these printed pages, that which has really caused whatever
success the "Stoddard Lectures" have achieved, may be
recalled precisely as the lectures were heard, accompanied
too by even more embellishment than illustrated them
at the time of their delivery. It has always given the writer
a singular sensation to meet his audiences season after season
after the separation of a year. Were they the same individuals
whom he had last addressed? He could not tell. They
could be absolutely sure of his identity, but he was quite
unable to determine theirs. Beyond the curve of platform
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_7' name='Page_7' href='#Page_7'>7</a></span>
or of stage, he could not distinguish the auditors of former
years from those who were seated there for the first time.
Sometimes they seemed to him scarcely more real and tangible
than were the views that came and went so noiselessly
upon the screen. He looked for a few moments at an amphitheatre
of expectant faces, then darkness would transform
them into rows of phantoms, and at the end he saw them
rise and disappear, like a great fleet of ships that separates
and scatters on a trackless sea.
</p>

<p>
In these volumes, however, he hopes to meet his audiences
more frequently, and for a longer time than ever before.
If, then, the oral lectures may have given the public some
enjoyment in the past, it is the author's hope that when he
himself no longer greets his former listeners, year by year,
these souvenirs of travel may in this form find a more enduring
place among the pleasures of their memories.
</p>

<p>
In that case he will not be utterly forgotten, for pleasant
memories can never be taken from us; they are the only joys
of which we can be absolutely sure.

NORWAY
</h2>

<p>
Of all the countries on our globe, Norway, in some
respects, must rank as the most wonderful. From
the North Cape to its most southern limit the distance
is about eleven hundred miles. Nearly one-third of this
great area lies within the Arctic circle. One would expect
its climate to be that of
Greenland; but Nature
saves it, as a habitation
for the race, by sending
thither the mysterious
Gulf Stream, which crosses
the Atlantic for five
thousand miles, and,
although far spent on that
distant shore, fulfills its
mission, transforming, by
its still warm breath, an
otherwise barren region to
a fertile land. But this is
only the beginning of Norway's
wonders. Exposed
to all the fury of the North Sea, Arctic and Atlantic, the
navigation of its coast would be well-nigh impossible had not
indulgent Nature made here countless breakwaters, by means
of a vast fringe of islands more than a thousand miles in
length, behind which are smooth, sheltered channels for the
largest ships.
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_12' name='Page_12' href='#Page_12'>12</a></span>
</p>

<p>
Again, Norwegian mountains come directly to the sea.
On this account, one might suppose that the interior would
be inaccessible. But Nature does here one more act of kindness,
and penetrates these mountain walls at many points
with ocean avenues, sometimes a hundred miles in length,
and with such depth that, at their farthest limits, steamers
may come directly to the shore. Moreover, to enhance its
mystery and beauty, Nature bestows on this, her favorite,
a day that is a summer long,—a light that never elsewhere
was on land or sea,—and
makes its
splendid vistas still
more glorious by a
midnight sun.

<p class="caption">THE HARBOR OF CHRISTIANIA.</p>
</div>

<p>
There have been
few experiences in
my life more joyous
and exhilarating
than my arrival
in Christiania. It
was six o'clock in
the morning as our
steamer glided up its noble harbor. The sky was cloudless;
the water of the deepest blue; a few white sails rose here and
there, like sea-gulls, from the waves. The forest-covered
islands, emerald to the water's edge, seemed gems upon the
bosom of the bay. Beyond, were mountains glistening in
an atmosphere, the like of which, for clearness, I had never
seen: while the first breath of that crisp, aromatic air (a
most delicious blending of the odors of mountain, sea, and
forest) can never be forgotten.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_13' name='Page_13' href='#Page_13'>13</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"This, this
is Norway!"
we exclaimed,
"and it is all
before us; first,
in the joy of
exploration; then
in the calmer,
though perpetual,
pleasure of
its retrospection."
</p>

<p class="caption">THE VICTORIA HOTEL.</p>
</div>

<p>
Excited by
our anticipations,
we disembarked
as
speedily as possible, and hastened to the Hotel Victoria. It
is a well-kept, comfortable hostelry, whose chief peculiarity
is a spacious courtyard, where frequently, in summer, <i><span lang='fr_FR'>table
d'hôte</span></i> is served beneath a mammoth tent of gorgeous colors.
Moreover, it is a pleasant rendezvous for travelers; for
while some tourists are here setting forth upon their inland
journey, others have just completed it,
and with bronzed faces tell strange
stories of the North, which sound like
tales invented by Munchausen.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">MR. BENNETT,
THE TRAVELER'S FRIEND.</p>
</div>

<p>
Impatient to arrange our route, after
a breakfast in the hotel courtyard we
went directly to the individual known
as "Bennett." "Bennett? Who is
Bennett?" the reader perhaps exclaims.
My friend, there is but one Norway,
and Bennett is its prophet. Bennett
is the living encyclopædia of Norway;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_14' name='Page_14' href='#Page_14'>14</a></span>
its animated map; its peripatetic guide-book. Nor is this
all. He is the traveler's guide, philosopher, and friend.
He sketches lengthy tours back and forth as easily as sailors
box the compass; tells him which roads to take and which
to avoid; sends word ahead for carriages and horses;
engages rooms for him within the Arctic circle; forwards
his letters, so that he may read them by the midnight
sun; gives him a list of carriage-coupons which the
coachmen cry for; and (more important still) so plans his
numerous arrivals and departures on the
coast that he may always find a train or steamer there
awaiting him. This is a most essential thing in Norway.

<p>
As a rule, Norwegian time-tables are about as difficult
to decipher as the inscriptions on a Chinese tea-caddy. Even
Bradshaw, the author of that English railway guide which
is the cause of so much apoplexy, came here to Norway
a few years ago, and died in trying to make out its post-road
and railway system. Some think that it was a judgment
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_17' name='Page_17' href='#Page_17'>17</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_16' name='Page_16' href='#Page_16'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_15' name='Page_15' href='#Page_15'></a></span>
upon him. At all events, his grave is near Christiania, and he
sleeps, while the "globe-trotter," whom he long befriended,
still rushes to and fro.
</p>

<p>
Although an Englishman by birth, "Bennett" has been
for fifty years a resident of Norway, and is a blessing to all
travelers in that country. At first he gave his services gratuitously;
but as the tourists began to multiply, he found that
such disinterestedness was impossible. He at length made
a business of it, and year by year it has steadily increased.
</p>

<p>
A new edition of his guide-book comes out every season;
and to still further help the public, he has begotten four
young Bennetts, who act as courteous agents for their
father, in Bergen, Trondhjem, and Christiania. He has
no "personally conducted
parties." He has no wish
to go outside of Norway.
But here, on account of
the peculiar style of traveling,
and the difficulty of the
language, it certainly is a
great convenience to employ
him.
</p>

<p class="caption">CHRISTIANIA FJORD.</p>
</div>

<p>
Our arrangements with
this guardian of Norwegian
tourists having at length
been concluded, we strolled
for some time through
Christiania's streets.
It is a clean
and cheerful city, though it
can boast of little architectural
beauty. The Royal
Palace is its finest building,
but even this, on close inspection,
proves to be more
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_18' name='Page_18' href='#Page_18'>18</a></span>
useful than ornamental,
and
well suited to a
nation forced to
practice strict
economy. In
inspecting the
structure it is
interesting to
remember how
independent
Norway is of Sweden, although both countries are governed
by one King. The Parliament in Christiania is wholly separate
from that of Stockholm. No Swede may hold political
office here. Even the power of the King is limited; for
if a bill is passed three times in the Norwegian Parliament,
then, notwithstanding the royal veto, it becomes law.

Moreover, in accordance with the Constitution, the King
of Sweden and Norway must be crowned in Norway; he must
reside here three months in the year; here, also, he must
open Parliament in person, and hold receptions, for no Norwegian
wishes to go to Stockholm for a presentation to
his sovereign. In this portion of his realm, also, he must
be addressed as "King of Norway and Sweden," not of
"Sweden and Norway." A
certain rivalry still exists
between
these two

<p class="caption">AN AMBIGUOUS SIGN.</p>
</div>

<p>
One of the first things
that attracted my attention
in my walks through
Christiania was the peculiar
sign, "Rum för
Resande." Judge not, however, from appearances in this
strange language of the north. It is said that not long ago
an English-speaking traveler of strong prohibition principles
was horrified at seeing this announcement frequently displayed.
</p>

<p>
"What does that last word 'Resande' mean?" he asked
suspiciously.
</p>

<p>
"Travelers," was the reply.
</p>

<p>
"Rum for travelers!" he exclaimed. "Oh, this is terrible!
What an insult to the traveling public! Now I, for one,
protest against such misrepresentation. I am a traveler, but
I never take a drop of rum."

"Not quite
so fast," rejoined
a Norwegian,
who
was laughing
heartily; "that
first word
means, not
<i>rum</i>, but <i>rooms</i>;
the whole sentence,
therefore,
merely
signifies, 'lodging
for travelers.'"
Eager
to start upon
our northward journey, we left some interesting features in
Christiania for a later visit, and on a beautiful June morning
set out for the coast. The train conveyed us in two
hours to Lake Mjösen, where we embarked upon a little
steamer. From that time on, although
continually traveling, we
saw no more railways for a month.
This lovely sheet of water has a
marvelous depth, its bed, in places,
being one thousand feet below the
level of the sea. This fact grows
more mysterious when we remember
that on the occasion of the
Lisbon earthquake, in 1755, the
waters of this lake, although so
remote from Portugal, were so terribly
disturbed, that they rose
suddenly to the height of twenty
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_21' name='Page_21' href='#Page_21'>21</a></span>
feet, and then as
suddenly subsided.

<p>
It was while
sailing on the
waters of Lake
Mjösen that we
had another curious
linguistic experience.
Next
to Norwegian or
Swedish, English
is best understood
and spoken
by the natives, especially among the seafaring population.
We did not know this fact at first, and as we had just come
from Germany, it seemed more natural to address the people
in the Teutonic tongue. You know the German word for
bright or clear is "hell." Accordingly, desiring to ask the
captain if he thought that the weather would be fine, my friend
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_22' name='Page_22' href='#Page_22'>22</a></span>
stepped up to him, and pointing to the sky, said interrogatively,
"Hell?"
</p>

<p>
"No," replied the captain, in perfectly good English,
"hell doesn't lie in that direction!"
</p>

<p>
A sail of several hours here through charming scenery
brought us at last to the place where we were to disembark.
Hardly had I set foot upon the pier, when a man accosted
me in good, familiar English:
</p>

<p>
"Just step this way, sir, if you please," he said; "the carriage
ordered for you by Mr. Bennett is all ready."
</p>

<p>
This surely was a pleasant introduction. There was no
trouble whatsoever—no bargaining, no delay. In fifteen
minutes we had started on our four days' journey to the sea.

<p class="caption">A LOVELY DRIVE.</p>
</div>

<p>
Between Christiania and the western coast is a broad
mountain range extending hundreds of miles north and south.
No railroad crosses that
gigantic barrier. True,
the town of Trondhjem,
in the north, can now be
reached circuitously by
rail. But all the great
southwestern coast, including
the towns of Bergen
and Molde, and the
large fjords, can only be
approached by several
magnificent highways, of
which the finest here
awaited us, the one extending
for a hundred
and sixty miles from Lake
Mjösen to the Songe fjord. And here one naturally asks,
"What is the mode of traveling in Norway? Where do you
eat? Where do you sleep? Do you take horses for the entire
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_25' name='Page_25' href='#Page_25'>25</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_24' name='Page_24' href='#Page_24'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_23' name='Page_23' href='#Page_23'></a></span>
journey, or from day to day?" It is easily explained. All
these Norwegian highways are divided into sections, each
about ten miles long. These sections have at one extremity
a "station"
(usually a farm-house),
the owner
of which is
obliged by law
to give to travelers
food and
lodging, and also
to supply them
with fresh horses
to the next station.

<p>
These Norwegian
post-houses
are invariably
made of
wood, sometimes elaborately carved and decorated. As you
approach the door, some member of the family greets you,
frequently in English, since many of these people have been in
America. If you desire to spend the night, you ask for rooms.
If you merely require dinner, you can be quickly served;
or if your purpose is to drive on still farther, you simply
order fresh horses. For these we never waited more than
fifteen minutes, though sometimes, in the height of the season,
serious delays take place. On this account it is better to precede
the crowd of tourists, and visit Norway early in the
summer. Such has been my experience, at least; and judging
from some stories I have heard of tourists sleeping
on the floor and dressing on the back piazza, I should emphatically
recommend this rule to all adventurers in the land
of Thor.

<p class="caption">A CARIOLE.</p>
</div>

<p>
But speaking
of Norwegian
post-stations reminds
one of the
characteristic vehicle
of Norway,—the
cariole.
This is by no
means a "carry-all."
It is a little gig, intended for only one person. True,
the boy (or, in some instances, the girl) who takes the horse
back after you have done with it, rides behind. His seat is
your valise, and his weight determines the subsequent condition
of its contents! There is a charming lightness in these
carioles. The springs are good, and the seat is easy. A
leather apron reaches to your waist to shield you from the
dust or rain; and, drawn by a Norwegian pony, such a drive
is wonderfully exhilarating.
</p>

<img src="images/i-033b.jpg" width="415" height="343" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE NATIONAL VEHICLE.</p>
</div>

<p>
These little carriages have, however, one great fault,—their
want of sociability. The linguistic powers of a Norwegian
post-boy are extremely limited; and when you have
ridden ten hours
a day, unable to
exchange a word
with your friends
except by shouting,
the drive becomes
a trifle
wearisome. But
the reader may
ask: "Is there
not sometimes
great discomfort
in traveling by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_27' name='Page_27' href='#Page_27'>27</a></span>
carioles in rainy
weather?" Assuredly
there is.
But in such
weather one is
not obliged to
take a cariole.
Norway has
other vehicles.
We drove, for
example, about a hundred and thirty miles in a sort of
victoria, the rear of which could be entirely covered in
case of rain. This, all in all, I hold to be the best conveyance
for the tourist in Norway, especially when ladies
are of the party. I know that such a carriage is considered
too luxurious by the English; but I am sure that American
ladies will gain more pleasure and profit from Norwegian
travel if they do not attempt to drive all day in carioles;
and if beneath the canopy provided they keep their clothing
dry.

<p>
At home we would not think of driving forty miles a day
in an open wagon through the rain; why, then, should
we do it unnecessarily in Norway,
where showers are proverbially both
frequent and copious? As for the fun
and novelty of cariole-riding, these
can always be had, for several hours
at a time, between one station and
another, even if one has engaged a
larger carriage for the entire journey,
for the cost of a cariole and pony for
half a day is ludicrously small, and
the change to it, occasionally, well
repays the slight expenditure.

<p>
But in thus speaking of the cariole, I have unwittingly
put the cart before the horse. A word of praise must certainly
be given to the usual Norwegian steed. Of all the ponies I
have ever seen, these of Norway are at once the strongest,
prettiest, and most lovable. They are usually of a delicate
cream color, with one dark line along the back, the mane
being always closely cut. These ponies are employed in Norway
almost universally, being not only less expensive but really
more enduring
than
the larger
horses. For
weeks we
drove behind
these little
animals, till
we had tested
certainly
seventy-five
of them, and never once did we observe in any of them the
slightest ugliness or a vicious trait. They are, moreover, wonderfully
sure-footed. I never saw one stumble or go lame.
Possibly, later in the season, when much over-worked, they
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_29' name='Page_29' href='#Page_29'>29</a></span>
may not have the spirit which we found in them; but in our
drives of more than two hundred miles there was not one
which did not cheerfully respond
to any call.

</div>

<p>
This being premised, let
us really begin our journey.
At first we found the
scenery more beautiful than
grand. In many places I
could have believed myself
in portions of either of the
American states of New
Hampshire or Vermont.
Across the fields I often
noticed long, dark lines
which, in the distance, looked
like hedges. On examination,
however, these
proved to be wooden fences,
covered with new-mown
grass; for, in this way, Norwegian
farmers "make hay
while the sun shines." Some
of these fences are very low,
but others have considerable
height. Norwegian farmers
claim that grass hung thus,
and thoroughly exposed to
wind and sun, will shed the
rain and dry more quickly
than if left upon the ground.
Their theory seems reasonable, and the extent of the hay
crop, which is very important, further justifies it. There is
one other argument in favor of these hay-racks,—during
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_30' name='Page_30' href='#Page_30'>30</a></span>
all other seasons of the year they serve as clothes-lines for
the family washing. But even more peculiar than the fences
were the vehicles used for hauling the hay into Norwegian
barns. We
laughed at first
sight of these
rustic carts.
They are only a
trifle larger than
a good-sized
cradle, and are
perched upon
the smallest
wheels I ever
saw on anything except a toy. Yet there is good reason
for their use, for on Norwegian farms the loads are drawn,
not by stout oxen, but by little ponies.
Moreover, the grass is often cut from
the edge of precipices, or in deep
ravines, and these low carts are
certainly better adapted than high
and heavy ones for locomotion in
such regions.

<p class="caption">AT A FARM HOUSE.</p>
</div>

<p>
While thus absorbed in agricultural
reflections, we drove up to
the house where we were to take
supper. A pleasant-featured girl,
with a baby in her arms, invited
us to enter. She spoke English
perfectly, having been born,
as we learned, in Minneapolis.
I shall never forget that first Norwegian supper. The name
for the evening meal in Norway is "aftenmad," but <i>often-mad</i>
would better express it in English. First, there were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_31' name='Page_31' href='#Page_31'>31</a></span>
placed before us five different kinds of cheese, the most
remarkable of which was a tall monument of chocolate-colored
substance made from goat's milk. This, by Norwegians,
is considered perfectly delicious; but for a month I shuddered
at it regularly three times a day. Next was brought in a jar
containing fish. At this my friend smiled joyfully.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">A NORWEGIAN HAY-FIELD.</p>
</div>

<p>
"Ah," he exclaimed, "here is fish! Anything in the
line of fish I can eat with a relish."
</p>

<p>
He drew a specimen from the jar, and put a portion
of it in his mouth. A look of horror instantly overspread
his face, and, covering his features with a napkin, he left
the room in haste. I quickly followed him, and found him
in the back yard gazing mournfully at some Norwegian swine.
</p>

<p>
"What is the matter?" I asked, "do you prefer pork
to fish?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe I do," he rejoined. Then turning to the girl,
who had followed us, he inquired, "What is the Norwegian
word for pork?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_32' name='Page_32' href='#Page_32'>32</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Griss,"<a name='FA_A' id='FA_A' href='#FN_A' class='fnanchor'>[A]</a> was
the reply.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you,"
he faltered, "I
don't think I
will take any to-day."
</p>

<p>
"Eh" (in an
aside to me),
"hadn't we better
drive on?"
</p>

<p>
"Drive on?"
I cried. "Drive
on, when there
is plenty of fish, which you always eat with so much relish?"

<p>
While this colloquy was taking place, we re-entered the
dining-room and asked for bread. We were amazed to see
what this request brought forth. Upon a plate almost
as large as the wheel of a Norwegian hay-cart was brought
to us a mound of circular wafers nearly three feet in circumference,
and each about as thick as one of our buckwheat cakes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_33' name='Page_33' href='#Page_33'>33</a></span>
They were made of rye meal and water (chiefly water), and
were so crisp that they would break to pieces at a touch.
This is called "flatbrod," and it is certainly in every sense the
flattest article ever invented for the human stomach. The
people, however, are fond of it, and I saw horses eat it frequently,
mistaking it (quite naturally, I am sure) for tablets
of compressed hay.

<p class="caption">NORWAY SCENERY.</p>
</div>

<p>
But here I shall probably be asked, "Is this the usual
state of things in Norway?" No, this first station was
unusually poor. The staple article of food in Norway
(always fresh and good) is salmon. Milk and sweet butter
can also be had, and eggs <i>ad libitum</i>. In fact, the abundance
of eggs here is probably responsible for the atrocious
witticism often perpetrated by Norwegian tourists, to the
effect that "if the sun does not set in Norway, hens do."
Mutton and beef are not obtainable, save at the large hotels,
their places being usually supplied by veal, sausage meat,
or reindeer hash. I met, while traveling here, an Englishman,
who said to me, "I did intend to drive on to Christiania;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_34' name='Page_34' href='#Page_34'>34</a></span>
but I really can't, you know; another month of this would
kill me. In the last two weeks I have eaten so many of these
'blasted eggs' that I'm ashamed to look a hen in the face!"
Yet, notwithstanding the hardships which the traveler meets
in Norway in regard to food, he will find all discomforts
easily outweighed
by the enjoyment
of the
trip. The constant
exercise in
the open air
gives powers
of digestion
hitherto unknown,
preceded
by an appetite
which
laughs at everything,
...
save cheese. Of
course, being so
far from any city, one cannot look for luxuries at these
small stations; indeed, I was surprised to find that the
peasants knew enough to give us, during a meal, several
knives and forks, hot plates, and other features of a well-served
table. And as far as prices are concerned, they are so
moderate as to provoke a smile from any one accustomed to
travel in other parts of Europe.

<p>
Yes, all ordinary discomforts sink into insignificance,
as I recall those memorable drives, day after day and hour
after hour, over lofty mountains, through noble forests, and
beside stupendous cliffs, the only sounds about us being
the songs of birds and the perpetual melody of numberless
cascades. Moreover, this mode of travel gave us the energy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_35' name='Page_35' href='#Page_35'>35</a></span>
of athletes. For how can I describe the invigoration and
sweetness of the air of Norway,—pure from its miles of
mountains,—rich with the fragrance of a billion pines, and
freshened by its passage over northern glaciers and the Arctic
sea?

As for Norwegian roads, they are among the finest in the
world. The majority of them are flanked with telegraph-poles;
for not only are these routes magnificent specimens of man's
triumph over nature, but the lightning also is controlled here,
and, swift as
light, thought
wings its way upon
a metal wire
through this inland
waste,—a
marvel always
wonderful and
ever new. Nature
has given
to these scenes
the trees and
rocks which
yield to nothing
but the wintry
blasts. Man
has suspended
here a thread of steel, which thrills responsive to the thoughts
of thousands, transmitting through the gloomiest gorges the
messages of love, hope, exultation, or despair. Hence one can
never feel completely isolated here. That little wire enables
him at any point to vanquish space, and by placing, as it were,
a finger on the pulse of life, to feel the heart-beats of the
world.

In 1888, two American gentlemen were traveling in Norway,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_36' name='Page_36' href='#Page_36'>36</a></span>
one of whom grew depressed at his apparent isolation from
humanity. His comrade, to astonish and console him, telegraphed
from one of the post-houses where they had stopped
for dinner, to the American consul at Christiania. The
message which he sent was this:
</p>

<p>
"Who was the Democratic nominee for President yesterday
in Chicago?"

</div>

<p>
Some of the roads on which we traveled here are cut
directly through the mountains. We found such tunnels
quite agreeable, since they furnished the only genuine darkness
to be found. So far as light is concerned, one may drive
through Norway in the summer just as well by night as by
day. Early and late indeed are words which in this region
grow meaningless. I could not keep a diary in Norway, so
difficult was it to tell when yesterday ended and to-day
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_37' name='Page_37' href='#Page_37'>37</a></span>
began. At first this seemed a great economy of time. We
felt that we were getting some advantage over Mother
Nature. "Why not drive on another twenty miles?" we
asked; "we can enjoy the scenery just as well;" or, "Why
not write a few letters now? It
is still light. In fact, why
go to bed at all?"
But after
a time
this everlasting
daylight grew
a trifle wearisome.
It thoroughly demoralized both our brains and our stomachs,
from the unheard of hours it occasioned for eating and
sleeping. Steamers will start in Norway at five o'clock
in the morning, or even at midnight. I once sat down
to a <i><span lang='fr_FR'>table d'hôte</span></i> dinner at half-past nine, and on another
occasion ate a lunch in broad daylight at two o'clock in the
morning. Moreover, even when we went to bed the sun's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_38' name='Page_38' href='#Page_38'>38</a></span>
rays stole between
our eyelids,
and dispelled
that
darkness which
induces slumber.
For,
strangely
enough, there
are rarely any
blinds or shutters
to Norwegian
windows.
Only a thin,
white curtain
screened us
usually from the glare of day. After a while, therefore, I
could sympathize with an American lady, whom I heard
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_39' name='Page_39' href='#Page_39'>39</a></span>
exclaim, "O, I would give anything for a good, pitch-dark
night twenty-four hours long!"

One characteristic of these roads made on my mind a
profound impression,
namely, the
boulders that have
been split off from
overhanging peaks
by frost and avalanche.
This is a
feature of Norwegian
scenery that
I have never seen
equaled in the
world. Sometimes
we drove through
such <i>débris</i> for half
an hour. Nor is
there the least exaggeration
in the
statement that
these boulders are
in many instances
as large as a house;
yet, when compared
with the gigantic
cliffs from which
they came, even
such monsters
seemed like pebbles. Some of these cliffs were frightful in
appearance. Again and again, when we had passed beneath
some precipice, one third of whose mass seemed only waiting
for a thunder-peal to bring it down, my friend and I would
draw a long, deep breath, and exchange glances of congratulation
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_40' name='Page_40' href='#Page_40'>40</a></span>
when we had
escaped its terrors.

<p>
A still more wonderful
feature of Norwegian
scenery is found
in its imposing waterfalls.
Nothing in Norway
so astonished me
as the unending number
and variety of its
cascades,—ribbons of
silver, usually, in the
distance, but foaming
torrents close at hand.
On any of these roads,
halt for a moment and
listen, and you will often hear a sound like that of the
surf upon the shore. It is the voice of falling water.

On our journey
toward the
coast, during a
drive of three
days we counted
one hundred
and sixty separate
falls, and
eighty-six in
the previous
ten hours. This
was an average
of more than
two in every
fifteen minutes.
True, we saw

these cascades in the month of June, when snow was melting
rapidly on the heights; but even in midsummer they must
far outnumber those in any other part of Europe.

In fact, although familiar with the Alps, and having driven
twice through all the valleys of the Pyrenees, I never knew
how many waterfalls one country could possess until I went
to Norway. There are, of course, magnificent falls in Switzerland,
and a great number of them in the Pyrenees; but where
you there see one cascade,
in Norway you
see twenty; and many
a Norwegian cataract
which would in Switzerland
draw thousands
of admiring tourists,
and make the fortune
of hotel proprietors, is
here, perhaps, without
a name, and certainly
without renown.

<p class="caption">BORGUND CHURCH.</p>
</div>

<p>
On our last day's
journey toward the
sea, we came in sight
of an extraordinary
building, on which we gazed in great astonishment, for it
seemed more appropriate to China than to Norway, and
was apparently completely out of place in this wild,
desolate ravine. It was the famous Borgund Church, a
place of early Christian worship, built about eight hundred
years ago. It therefore ranks (unless one other similar church
be excepted) as the oldest structure in all Norway. It is so
small that one could almost fancy it a church for dwarfs.
Around the base is a kind of cloister, from which the dim
interior receives its only light. Within is one small room,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_44' name='Page_44' href='#Page_44'>44</a></span>
scarcely forty feet long, containing
now no furniture save
a rough-hewn altar. As for
its various roofs and pinnacles,
marked now by crosses,
now by dragons' heads, nothing
could be more weirdly
picturesque, especially as the
entire edifice is black,—in
part from age, but chiefly
from the coats of tar with
which it has been painted for
protection.

Leaving this ancient church,
we soon found ourselves in one
of the most stupendous of Norwegian gorges. It is hardly
possible for any view to do it justice. But for awe-inspiring
grandeur I have never seen its magnificence surpassed, even
in the Via Mala. For miles
the river Laerdal makes
its way here through gigantic
cliffs, which rise on
either side to a height of
from four thousand to five
thousand feet. The space,
however, between these
mountain sides is barely
wide enough for the river,
which writhes and struggles
with obstructing boulders,
lashing itself to creamy
foam, and filling the chasm
with a deafening roar. Yet,
above the river, a roadway
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_47' name='Page_47' href='#Page_47'>47</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_46' name='Page_46' href='#Page_46'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_45' name='Page_45' href='#Page_45'></a></span>
has been hewn
out of the mountain-side
itself,
which is lined
with parapets of
boulders. When
marking out the
route the engineers
were often
lowered over
the precipice by ropes. One can imagine nothing more
exciting than this drive. When mountains did not actually
overshadow us, in looking aloft we could discern only a
narrow rift of sky, like a blue river, curbed by granite banks.
Below us was the seething flood, at once terrible and glorious
to look upon. Shut in by these huge, somber walls, we
followed all the windings of the stream, whirling about their
corners at a speed which seemed the more terrific from our
wild surroundings. There are few things in life that have
affected me so powerfully as the Laerdal gorge, and I would
once more go to Norway for that drive alone. Certain it is
that at the end of it we found ourselves exhausted, not physically,
but nervously, from the tremendous tension and
excitement of the last few hours in this wild ravine. Finally,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_48' name='Page_48' href='#Page_48'>48</a></span>
leaving this sublime mountain scenery, we saw between us
and the coast our destination—the little town of Laerdalsören.
Thrilled though we were with memories of what we
had just seen, and grateful, too, that our long drive from
sea to sea had been successfully completed, our serious
reflections vanished at the threshold of this village. My
companion had found it hard to be so long deprived of
news from home. Accordingly, he remarked to me as we
came in sight of Laerdalsören:
</p>

<p>
"I somehow feel to-day a great anxiety about my boys,
William and Henry. I am not superstitious, but I have
a presentiment that they need me. Hark!" he said suddenly,
"what's that?"
</p>

We stopped the vehicle and listened. It was the music
of an English hand-organ; and I am speaking only the literal
truth when I say that the tune which we then heard it play
was that of "Father, dear father, come home with me now."

<p>
Early next morning we left our good hotel and hastened
to the steamer which awaited us upon the fjord. "What,
precisely, is a fjord?" some may inquire. In briefest terms,
it is a mountain gorge connected with the ocean, a narrow
arm of the sea extending inland, sometimes for one hundred
miles. Moreover, to carry out the simile, at the extremity of
every such long
arm are "fingers;"
that is,
still narrower extensions,
which
wind about the
bases of the
mountains till
they seem like
glittering serpents
lying in
the shadow of
tremendous
cliffs.
</p>

<p class="caption">A FJORD.</p>
</div>

<p>
Thus in one
sense, here at
Laerdalsören, we had reached the sea, but in another, it
was still eighty-five miles away. Yet we were now to
embark on a large ocean steamer, lying but a few yards
from the shore, for these mysterious fjords are sometimes
quite as deep as the mountains over them are high. They
open thus the very heart of Norway to the commerce
of the world. And as our steamer glided from one mountain-girdled
basin into another, I realized why this western
coast of Norway is one of the most remarkable land-formations
on the globe. If we were able to look down upon it
from an elevation, we should perceive that from the mountain
chain, which forms, as it were, the backbone of the country,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_50' name='Page_50' href='#Page_50'>50</a></span>
a multitude of grooves stretch downward to the shore
between the elevations, like spaces between the teeth of a comb.
Into these mountain crevices, formed in the misty ages of the
past, the sea now makes its way, continually growing narrower,
until at last it winds between frowning cliffs of fearful height,
down which stream numerous waterfalls, the spray from which
at times sweeps
over the steamer
as it glides along.
Traveling, therefore,
on these
ocean avenues
is like sailing
through Switzerland.

<p>
Delighted beyond
measure
with this new experience,
some
two or three
hours after leaving
Laerdalsören, we gradually approached the most sublime
of all these ocean highways,—the Naerofjord. No general
view can possibly portray its grandeur. The only way to
appreciate the vastness of its well-nigh perpendicular cliffs
is to compare them with some objects on the banks. In
many places, for example, cattle grazing on the shore, compared
with their giant environment, seemed like mice, and a
church steeple appeared no larger than a pine-cone.

<p>
As we sailed further up this beautiful expanse, it was
difficult to realize that we were floating on an arm of the

Atlantic. It had the appearance rather of a gloomy lake
shut in by mountains never trodden by the foot of man.
On either side was a solemn array of stupendous precipices—sheer,
awful cliffs—refusing even the companionship of pines
and hemlocks, and frequently resembling a long chain of icebergs
turned to stone. The silence, too, was most impressive.
There was, at times, no sign of life on sea or shore. The influence
of this was
felt upon the
boat, for if any
of us spoke, it
was in a tone
subdued by the
solemnity of our
surroundings.

<p class="caption">CONTINUALLY GROWING NARROWER.</p>
</div>

<p>
As we pursued
our way,
sometimes we
could discern no
outlet whatever;
then, suddenly,
our course
would turn, and
another glorious vista would appear before us. We sat
at the prow of the boat; and there, with nothing but the
awe-inspiring prospect to contemplate, we sailed along in silence
through this liquid labyrinth. So close together were the cliffs,
that when, for the sake of the experiment, I lay down on the
deck and looked directly upward, I could at the same instant
see both sides of the fjord cutting their outlines sharply on the
sky! Mile after mile, these grim, divided mountains stood
gazing into each other's scowling faces, yet kept apart by this
enchanting barrier of the sea, as some fair woman intervenes
between two opposing rivals, each thirsting for the other's
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_54' name='Page_54' href='#Page_54'>54</a></span>
blood. It is such scenery as Dante might describe and Doré
illustrate. We wondered what such ravines would look
like without water.
They would be terrible
to gaze
upon. They would resemble
gashes in a dead man's face,
or chasms on the surface of
the moon, devoid of atmosphere
and life. But water
gives to them vitality, and
lights up all their gloomy gorges with a silvery flood, much
as a smile illumines, while it softens, a furrowed face.

Nor is the
water in these
fjords less marvelous
than the
land. Its depth,
in places, is estimated
at three
thousand feet.
When we sailed
up the Naerofjord,
its color
was so green,
and its surface
so completely
motionless, that
we seemed to
be gliding over a highway paved with malachite. Whether
the coloring of these ocean avenues is due to their great depth,
to the crystal clearness of the atmosphere, or to the reflection
of the forests on their banks, certain it is that I have nowhere
else (save in the blue grotto
at Capri) seen water tinted
with such shades of robin's-egg
blue and emerald green.
In confirmation of this fact,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_58' name='Page_58' href='#Page_58'>58</a></span>
we noticed with astonishment
that whenever the white seagulls,
wheeling round our boat, would
sink breast downward toward
the waves, the color of the sea
was so intense, that their white
wings distinctly changed their
hue in the reflected light, assuming
a most delicate tint, which
gradually vanished as they rose
again!

<p class="caption">A SUBLIME WATERFALL.</p>
</div>

<p>
After a sail of several hours,
we approached the terminus of
the Naerofjord, at which is located
the little hamlet of Gudvangen.
So narrow is the valley
here, that through the winter
months no ray of sunlight falls
directly on the town, and even in
the longest day in summer it can
receive the sunshine only for a
few hours. It seemed depressing
to remain in such eternal shadow.
Accordingly, we halted only a
few moments at the place, and
taking a carriage which awaited
us, we drove beyond the village
into the ravine so celebrated for
its grandeur—the Naerodal. One
sees at once that this is really a
continuation of the Naerofjord
without the water. There can
be little doubt that, formerly, the
ocean entered it, and one could
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_61' name='Page_61' href='#Page_61'>61</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_60' name='Page_60' href='#Page_60'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_59' name='Page_59' href='#Page_59'></a></span>
then have sailed where we now had to drive. And what
is true of the Naerodal is also true of other such ravines. In
every case the grooved hollows continue inland and upward,
but the gradual elevation of the coast has caused the ocean
to retreat. This is a place of great sublimity. On either
side rise mountains from four to five thousand feet in height—sometimes
without a vestige of vegetation on their precipitous
sides—which
are, however,
seamed with
numberless cascades,
apparently
hung upon
the cliffs like
silver chains.

<p>
The most
remarkable object
in the valley
we found to
be a peculiarly
shaped mountain,
called the
Jordalsnut. Its
form is that of
a gigantic thimble, and as its composition is a silvery feldspar,
it fairly glitters in the sun, or glows resplendent in the
evening light,—an object never to be forgotten. Those who
have looked upon this dome by moonlight say that the effect
is indescribable; and, in fact, moonlight in these awful gorges
and fjords must give to them a beauty even more weird and
startling than that of day. Of this, however, I cannot speak
from experience, since moonlight is in summer very faint
in Norway, and it is only earlier or later in the year that
one can see this wonderful country thus transfigured.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_62' name='Page_62' href='#Page_62'>62</a></span>
</p>

<p>
In driving up the Naerodal, one sees, at the head of the
valley, what looks like an irregular chalk-line on a blackboard.
It is a famous carriage-road, which has been blasted out of the
mountain-side, and built up everywhere with solid masonry.
Even now it is so difficult of ascent for horses that every traveler
who is able
usually climbs
that curving
road on foot.

</div>

<p>
In doing so,
we stopped at
intervals to enjoy
the marvelous
scenery, and
especially to behold
the two attractive
features
of the mountain.
For this grand
terminus of the
Naerodal is
flanked on either
side by a magnificent
waterfall;
and since the
path continually
curves, one or
the other of these torrents is constantly visible. Either of
them is the equal of any Swiss cascade I ever saw, and makes
even the famous Giessbach sink into insignificance, and yet
these are not ranked among the best Norwegian specimens.
We could not, however, appreciate them as we should have
done if they had been the first that we had seen; for when a
tourist has counted eighty-six cascades in one day's drive,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_63' name='Page_63' href='#Page_63'>63</a></span>
and has just run
the gauntlet of
some twenty

<p>
Upon the
summit of the wooded cliff toward which this driveway leads,
is a speck which at a distance resembles a white flag outlined
on the forest background. It is the Hotel Stalheim.
As we approached it, a man stepped up to us and exclaimed:
"Hullo, strangers;
are you
Americans?"
</p>

<p>
"I am glad to
say that we are,"
was my reply.
</p>

<p>
He instantly
stretched out
his hand and
said "Shake!"—"What
kind of
business are you
in?" he presently
inquired.

</p>

<p>
"Well," he remarked,
"I'm a
manufacturer of barrel
hoops. Norway's
all right. I took
an order for forty

</p>

<p>
At the dinner
table, where he had
greatly amused every
one by his stories, he
suddenly called out:
"Waiter, is there anything worth seeing on that 'ere road
down there?"
</p>

<p>
"It is one of the finest drives in Norway, sir," replied the
waiter.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I reckon I'll have to do it, then," he ejaculated:
and soon after
dinner he departed
in a cariole.
An hour
later, as I was
sitting on the
piazza gazing on
the glorious
prospect, I saw
him coming
back. "How is
this?" I exclaimed;
"I
thought you
were going to

</p>

<p>
"'Waterfalls,' said he.
</p>

</p>

<p>
I must not fail to add that there was an extremely pretty
girl at the hotel, to whom our eccentric compatriot paid much
attention. Some English travelers, therefore, looked greatly
puzzled when they heard him say to her on taking leave:
"Good-by! I hope <i>I'll strike you</i> again somewhere on the

<p>
After supper that evening we took an extended walk. It
was eleven o'clock, and yet the snow-capped mountains which
surrounded us were radiant with the sunset glow. We presently
encountered two young peasants returning from their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_68' name='Page_68' href='#Page_68'>68</a></span>
work. To them we spoke a few Norsk words that we had
learned since coming to Norway, whereupon one of the lads
drew from his pocket a pamphlet and presented it to me with
a polite bow. It proved to be a book of phrases, half-English
and half-Norsk, designed to help Norwegian emigrants
on landing in
America. Not
knowing, however,
what it
was at first, I
opened it and
could hardly believe
my eyes,
when, in this
lonely valley in
the heart of
Norway, and by
the light of a
midnight sun,
I read these
words: "Wake
up! Here we are in Chicago!" "Change cars for Omaha
and the West!" "Don't lean out of the window, or you'll
have your head knocked off!"
</p>

<p class="caption">ALL READY TO "SHAKE HANDS."</p>
</div>

<p>
Both of these bright boys hoped the next summer to
"wake up in Chicago." It is, in fact, the great desire of
Norwegian youths to go to America, and some are brave
enough to do so with a capital of only twenty-five dollars.
Their knowledge of the United States is, of course, limited,
but one place there is known to all of them. Again and
again we were subjected to the following questions: "Are
you English?"
</p>

<p>
"No."
</p>

<p>
"Americans?"
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_69' name='Page_69' href='#Page_69'>69</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Yes."
</p>

<p>
"<span class="smcap">Chicago?</span>"
</p>

<p>
That was the place for them, evidently. New York is better
than nothing, but Chicago is the El Dorado of the Scandinavians,
for to that place they usually buy through-tickets,
as to the doorway of the great Northwest.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the Hotel Stalheim, after a short stay, a glorious
drive awaited us down to the Hardanger Fjord. At frequent
intervals along this route we encountered gates designed to
keep the cattle within certain limits. Women and children
usually stood near-by to open them, expecting in return a
trifling payment. Yet when I offered them a coin, I was
sometimes surprised to see their hands still lingering near my
own. At first I thought
that they, like Oliver Twist,
were asking for more, but
presently I discovered that
they merely wished to shake
hands and say good-by, for
hand-shaking in Norway is
universal. If you bestow a
fee upon your cariole-boy,
your boot-black, or your
chambermaid, each will offer
his or her hand to you and
wish you a happy journey.
A pleasant custom, truly,
but, on the whole, it is advisable
for travelers in Norway
to wear gloves. I usually responded cheerfully to this
mode of salutation, though sometimes, when I saw what
kind of a hand the peasant "held,"—I "passed!"

<p>
As we drove on, we noticed here and there the houses of
the poorer farmers. They are invariably made of wood, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_70' name='Page_70' href='#Page_70'>70</a></span>
some, constructed out of huge spruce logs, look as enduring
as the hills that surround them. The roofs are covered
first with pieces of birch-bark, laid on the logs like shingles.
On these are placed two layers of sod—the upper one with
its grassy surface toward the sky. This grass is sometimes
mown for hay. Occasionally a homœopathic crop of grain
will grow here.
In almost every
case the top of
the house looks
like a flower-garden;
and I
once saw a
bearded goat
getting his
breakfast on his
master's roof.

<p>
Occasionally,
a little distance
from the house,
we saw another
smaller structure,
built beside
a river; for the water-power of Norway is made use of
in some simple way by almost all the country people. Many
a peasant has a tiny water-wheel which turns a grindstone,
or even a mill, and thus his scythes are sharpened and his
grain is ground on his own premises. Such farmers, therefore,
are their own millers, and frequently their own blacksmiths,
too, and they can shoe their ponies with considerable
skill.

<p>
In traveling through Norway it is most interesting to
observe how the people utilize every available portion of the
land. Wire ropes extend from the valleys up the mountain
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_73' name='Page_73' href='#Page_73'>73</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_72' name='Page_72' href='#Page_72'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_71' name='Page_71' href='#Page_71'></a></span>
sides, and are used for letting down
bundles of compressed hay, after it has
been reaped, gathered, and packed on
some almost inaccessible plateau. On
elevations, where it seems well-nigh
impossible for man to gain a foothold,
people will scramble, at the hazard of
their lives, to win a living from the
little earth that has there found lodgment.
Seeing with our own eyes these
habitable eyries, we could well believe
what we were told, that goats, and even
children, are often tied for safety to the
door-posts, and that the members of a
family who die on such elevated farms
are sometimes lowered by ropes a thousand feet down to the
valley or fjord.

<p>
It was on this journey that I took my first and never-to-be-forgotten
cariole-ride in Norway.
On this occasion, my driver was a
small boy, ten years old, just young
and mischievous enough to laugh at
danger and be reckless. I noticed
that his mother cautioned him before
we started. She evidently
understood him. I did not. Accordingly,
while I took the reins, I
gave him the whip. Springing like
a monkey into his place behind me,
he cracked his whip and off we
went. The road was good, and for
half an hour I thoroughly enjoyed
it. Then we began to descend,
and suddenly dashed across a bridge
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_74' name='Page_74' href='#Page_74'>74</a></span>
beneath which was a foaming cataract. I naturally reined
the pony in. But, to my surprise, the more I pulled, the
faster went the pony. "Whoa!" I exclaimed; "whoa!"
but whether prolonged or uttered with staccato emphasis
that word made no apparent difference in the pony's gait.
"Whoa," was evidently not in its vocabulary. My hair
began to stand on end. Perceiving this, the demon of a
boy commenced to utter the most unearthly yells, and to
crack his whip until he made the pony actually seem to fly.

<p>
"Go slowly," I exclaimed. Crack, crack, went the whip.
</p>

<p>
"Stop that, you young rascal." Crack, crack, crack! I
tried to seize the whip, but my tormentor held it far behind
him. I sought to turn and petrify him with a look, but it
was like trying to see a fly between my shoulder-blades. I
saw that I was only making faces at the mountains.

To appreciate my feelings, one should perceive the winding
road along which I was traveling. It was a splendid
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_75' name='Page_75' href='#Page_75'>75</a></span>
specimen of engineering
skill,
but after twenty-seven
of
these curves, I
felt that I was
getting cross-eyed.
Fancy
me perched, as
it were, upon
a good-sized
salad-spoon,
flying around
the mountain
side, with one
wheel in the air
at every turn, at the rate of the Chicago Limited going
round the Horse-shoe Bend. I looked back at my companion,
whose
horse, excited
by my own,
was just behind
me. His face
was deathly
pale. Anxiety
was stamped
on every feature.
His lips
moved as if
entreating me
to slacken this
terrific speed.
Finally, he
faintly cried:
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_76' name='Page_76' href='#Page_76'>76</a></span>
"If you escape, ... give my
love ... to my children, ...
William and Henry!"

At last I saw, some little
way ahead, a cart half-blocking
the road. "Great heavens!" I
thought, "here comes a collision!
Well, it might as well end this way
as any other. No more lectures
for me!" But, lo! there issued
from the small boy's lips the
sound, "Purr-r-r!" The effect
was instantaneous. The horse at
once relaxed his speed, and in a
moment came to a full stop. For
"purring" is to a Norwegian pony
what the Westinghouse air-brake is to an express train. This
secret learned, we had no further trouble. For "purr," when
uttered by American lips, proved always as effectual as by
Norwegian.

A few hours after that eventful ride, we found ourselves
upon the great
Hardangerfjord,
which, with its
branches, has a
length of one
hundred and
forty miles.
These ocean
avenues possess
not merely natural
beauty:
they also have

This part of Norway, for example, is old Viking ground.
Not far from here lived Rollo, conqueror of Normandy;
and from these fjords a thousand years ago went forth
those dauntless warriors of the north, who for two hundred
years not only ravaged England, France, and Ireland,
but even crossed the Atlantic to America hundreds of years
before Columbus sailed from Spain.

<p class="caption">AN ANCIENT BOAT OF NORWAY.</p>
</div>

<p>
In this connection, therefore, let me say that, to me, the
most interesting object in Christiania was its Viking ship. This
most impressive relic of the past was found some fourteen years
ago within an ancient mound beside the sea. It had reposed
there for ten centuries, owing its preservation to the hard, blue
clay in which it was entombed. It was made entirely of oak,
and was propelled sometimes by oars, sometimes by a sail.
Within it was discovered a well-carved wooden chair, in which,
no doubt, the chieftain sat. Some kettles, too, were here,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_80' name='Page_80' href='#Page_80'>80</a></span>
and plates and drinking-cups, used by the Vikings when they
landed to prepare a meal. But, more remarkable still, this
boat contained some human bones. For in those early days
such boats were often used as funeral barges for their brave
commanders. The vessel, even when buried, was always
headed toward the sea, so that when called by Odin once
more into life, the chief whose body was thus sepulchered
might be ready to start at once and sail again the ocean he
had loved so well.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally, however, a Viking had a grander form of
burial. Sometimes, when an old Norwegian chieftain felt
that he was dying, he ordered that his body, when lifeless,
should be placed within his boat, which was then filled with
light materials and set on fire. The large sail was then spread,
and the dead warrior drifted out before the wind, his gallant
vessel for a funeral pyre, and for his liturgy the chanting of
the waves. As for the Viking himself, he doubtless had faced
death, sustained by an unfaltering belief which, had he been
more cultivated, might have thus expressed itself:
</p>

<p>
"If my bark sink, 'tis to another sea."
</p>

<p>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_81' name='Page_81' href='#Page_81'>81</a></span>
</p>

<p>
At the extremity of one of the branches of the Hardangerfjord
is the little town of Odde. This was the only place in
Norway where we had any difficulty in securing rooms. As
the boat neared the wharf, I heard a dozen ladies whisper to
their husbands: "Now, dear, you stay and look after the
luggage, and I'll run on and get the rooms." Accordingly,
I used the same words to my friend, with the exception of the
endearing epithet. I was afraid that might make him homesick.
Then I took my position near the gang-plank.

<p>
When we arrived, I was the first to step ashore, and I
started at a brisk walk toward the hotel. Behind me I could
hear the rustling of many skirts, but, hardening my heart like
Pharaoh, I kept on. At last, forgetting drapery and dignity,
the ladies passed me on the run. This time I gallantly gave
way, and when, a moment later, I reached the hotel office,
I could have fancied myself on the floor of the Stock Exchange,
since every lady there was fighting nobly for her
children and her absent lord.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_82' name='Page_82' href='#Page_82'>82</a></span>

<p>
"I want two beds," cried one.
</p>

<p>
"I wish for five beds," screamed another.
</p>

<p>
"Give me a room with blinds," exclaimed a third.
</p>

<p>
The female clerk, meantime, having completely lost her
head, was calling off numbers like an auctioneer. Suddenly
she turned to
me, who had not
yet opened my
mouth, and almost
paralyzed
me with these
words:
</p>

<p>
"Number 20
will do for you,
<i>three beds and
one cradle</i>!"
</p>

<p>
When I recovered
from my
swoon, I found
that my friend
had come up
quietly after the battle, and had secured two single rooms.

<p>
Saying farewell to Odde, a day's delightful sail between
majestic mountains brought us to one of Norway's most
important cities—Bergen. Although we lingered here three
days, we had the wonderful experience of continual sunshine.
I rightly call it wonderful; for Bergen is the rainiest city in the
world and is sarcastically called "The fatherland of drizzle."
The people in Christiania claim that in Bergen when a horse
sees a man <i>without</i> an umbrella, he shies! It is also said that
a sea-captain, who was born in Bergen, and all his life had
sailed between his native city and the outer world, came one
day into its harbor when by chance the sun was shining.
At once he put about and set forth to sea again, believing that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_85' name='Page_85' href='#Page_85'>85</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_84' name='Page_84' href='#Page_84'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_83' name='Page_83' href='#Page_83'></a></span>
he had made a mistake in his port. As we approached the
pier at Bergen, I saw what, in the distance, appeared to be
a mob. It proved, however, to be the usual crowd which
gathers round the Bergen Fish Market.
</p>

<p>
This is not, after all, so strange if we reflect that fish is the
great commodity of Bergen, and that this city is the chief
distributing station for Norwegian fish to the entire world.
Several centuries ago, a company of German merchants, who
formed the famous Hanseatic League, established themselves
here and held for years within their hands the monopoly of
all the fishing trade of Norway, compelling even the Norwegian
fishermen to send their catch of fish to Bergen for reshipment
to other ports of Europe. It is true the league
exists no longer,
but its influence
still survives,
and nothing can
divert the trade
from following
in its ancient
channel. Over
the hills that rise
above the city
a splendid driveway
has been
made. A Bergen
resident spoke of
it to me as "The
Drink Road."

"What is the meaning of so strange a title?" I inquired.
</p>

<p>
"It is so called," he said, "because it is constructed
wholly out of the profits derived from the sale of ardent
spirits." Observing my astonishment, he added: "Do you
not understand our famous liquor law in Bergen?"

added, "by
pointing out to
you that melancholy
individual
standing by the gang-plank. He used to be a liquor-seller
here, but he has lost his 'spirits,' for our municipal government
now has the sale of liquors entirely in its own hands.
It first decides how many licenses are needed, and then,
instead of giving them to private individuals, it grants them
only to a responsible stock company. The books of this
company must be at all times open to inspection, and all
its rules are strictly under government control. Moreover,
the company is not allowed to make more than five per cent.
on its invested
capital. All
profits over that
amount are
given to public
improvements,
roads, parks,
schools, or hospitals."
</p>

<p>
I asked if
the law gave
general satisfaction.

"We are delighted with it," was the answer. "It is
now thirteen years since it was started, and all the prominent
towns in Norway, except three, have followed our example.
The liquors, in the first place, are all carefully selected.
Secondly, the bars are not attractive gin-palaces, but plain
rooms, with no seats for customers. No loitering on the
premises is allowed. Only a small amount is sold at any one
time. Children are not allowed to serve as messengers.
Even the bartenders
are appointed
by the
government, and
wear a uniform
and a number,
by which they
can be easily
identified in case
of complaint;
and as a practical
result," he
added, "by taking
the liquor
traffic out of
the hands of
irresponsible
agents the annual amount of ardent spirits sold has been
reduced from twelve and a half to five and a half million
quarts; and yet our Bergen company has earned each year
a net profit of one hundred and twenty-five per cent., one
hundred and twenty of which is, as I have said, applied to
public charities!"

But to me the most interesting sight in Bergen was the
grave of the Norwegian violinist, Ole Bull. His last appearance
in America was in 1879—too long ago perhaps for many
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_88' name='Page_88' href='#Page_88'>88</a></span>
to recollect him—for, alas! even those who entertain the
public best are soon forgotten. But some of my readers
no doubt recall that Paganini of the North, tall and erect,
with large blue eyes and flaxen hair—the personification
of a valiant Norseman, whose fire and magnetism in this nineteenth
century displayed themselves in music rather than in
maritime adventure. As his old Viking ancestors had no doubt
wielded sword and battle-ax, so his bow was of such unusual
length that no
one of inferior
strength and
stature could
have used it advantageously.

<p>
From this
musician's
grave one looks
off over the
lovely bay of
Bergen. This
peaceful view,
which he so
loved, produced
upon my mind,
in the soft
evening light, the same effect as did the music of that skillful
hand which now reposed beneath the flowers. To me his
playing was enchanting, and unlike that of any other violinist
I have ever heard. There was a quality in the tones that he
would call forth from his violin, which seemed as weird and
fascinating as the poetry of the sagas, and as mysterious as
the light which lingered on his mountains and fjords. What
wonder that his death in 1880 was deplored in Norway as a
national calamity?

<p>
Taking our leave reluctantly of
Bergen, we entered on what proved
to be one of the most delightful
features of our tour in Norway, a
sail of twenty-four hours along the
coast to the town of Molde. How
can I adequately describe that
most unique and memorable
journey? Our entire course lay
through a labyrinth of islands,
beyond which, every now and
then, we gained a glimpse of the
Atlantic rolling away toward the
horizon. The proximity and number of these islands astonished
me. For, hour after hour, they would come into
sight, wheel by us slowly, and then disappear, to be succeeded
by their counterparts. We went down to dinner or to our
staterooms, yet when we came on deck again, islands
still surrounded us. We saw them glittering in the sunset
ere we went to sleep, and in the morning we were once more
environed by them. Sometimes I could have fancied that
they were sailing with us, like a vast convoy of protecting
gunboats, moving when we moved, halting when we halted,
patient and motionless till we resumed our voyage.
</p>

<p class="caption">THE NORWEGIAN COAST.</p>
</div>

<p>
Meantime, just opposite these islands, is the coast,—a
grand succession of bold headlands and dark, gloomy mountains,
beyond which always are still higher summits capped
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_90' name='Page_90' href='#Page_90'>90</a></span>
with snow. At frequent intervals some beautiful fjord leads
inward, like the entrance to a citadel; and here and there,
within a sheltered nook, we see some fishing hamlet crouching
on the sand. This is surely the perfection of ocean
travel. For, though this mountain-bordered channel is hundreds
of miles in length, the sea within it is as smooth as a
canal. Once only throughout the day was the great swell
of the Atlantic
felt, when for a
little space the
island breakwater
was gone.

<p class="caption">A WONDERFUL PANORAMA.</p>
</div>

<p>
Our sail along
the coast had,
late at night, a
most appropriate
ending in
our arrival at Molde. There are few places in the world
more beautiful. It lies upon the bank of a fjord, on the
opposite side of which is an array of snowy mountains forty
miles in length. Molde is sometimes called the "Interlaken
of Norway," but that does not by any means describe
it. For here there is no single mountain, like the Jungfrau,
to compel our homage, but rather a long series of majestic
peaks, resembling a line of icebergs drifting in crystal splendor
from the polar sea.
</p>

<p>
Filled with enthusiasm over this splendid spectacle, we
left the steamer, and soon found ourselves within a comfortable
hotel. It was the hour of midnight, but, far from
being dark, the eastern sky was even then brightening with
the coming dawn. A party of excursionists was just returning
from a mountain climb. Some passengers were embarking
on the steamer we had left. Supper or breakfast (I know not
which to call it) was awaiting us. Under such circumstances
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_91' name='Page_91' href='#Page_91'>91</a></span>
it seemed ridiculous to go to bed. Accordingly, we laughed
and chatted on the balcony, until a wretched man thrust out
his head from an adjoining window, and remarked:
</p>

<p>
"My friends, I am glad to see you happy, but I have just
returned from the North Cape. I haven't slept for eight
nights. It seems quite dark here by comparison, and I was
hopeful of a good night's rest. Would you just as lief postpone
your fun until you get inside the Arctic circle?"
</p>

<p>
This pathetic appeal could not be resisted, and asking his
forgiveness, we retired.
</p>

<p>
Taking leave of Molde one pleasant afternoon, we sailed
across its beautiful fjord to explore the snow-capped mountains
opposite. It was upon this voyage that I was taught
the bitter lesson never to trust my baggage to a Norwegian,
merely because he claims to be able to speak English. Upon
the deck of our little steamer stood that day a man, upon
whose hatband I read the legend that he was the proprietor
of a hotel at Veblungsnäs, where we proposed to spend the
night. Approaching him, therefore, I inquired:
</p>

<p>
"Can you speak English?"
</p>

<p>
He smiled upon me sweetly, and replied, "O, yes."
</p>

<p>
Innocent of the awful fact that this was the whole extent
of his vocabulary, I continued:
</p>

<p>
"When we arrive, will you bring my valise ashore, while
I go at once to the hotel to secure rooms?"
</p>

<p>
"O, yes."
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later we reached our landing pier. I left the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_92' name='Page_92' href='#Page_92'>92</a></span>
boat, as I had said, and hurried on to the hotel. I presently
beheld the old proprietor coming from the wharf, but without
my satchel.
</p>

<p>
"What does
this mean?" I
cried; "did you
not bring my
valise off the
steamer?"
</p>

<p>
"O, yes."
</p>

<p>
"Where is it,
then? Is it not
on there still?"
</p>

<p>
"O, yes."
</p>

<p>
"Mercy on
me! Is not that
the steamer going off with my valise on board?"
</p>

<p>
"O, yes!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, are you not a monumental idiot, then?"
</p>

<p>
"O, yes!"
</p>

<p>
It took me three days to recover that valise; and the important
lesson of "<i>O, yes</i>," was effectually learned.
</p>

<p>
Early next morning we took leave of Veblungsnäs, and
drove directly towards the Romsdal, one of the finest valleys
in all Norway. Before us, like a mighty sentinel, the imposing
Romsdalhorn rose, dark with somber shadows, to an
altitude of five thousand and ninety feet. The peak itself,
five hundred feet in height, is said to be almost as dangerous
to ascend as the appalling Matterhorn, not only
on account of its perpendicular sides, but also from the
crumbling nature of the rock, which renders it impossible to
fasten iron bars in its surface.
</p>

<p>
Some years ago, an English tourist, after a number of unsuccessful
efforts, finally reached the summit of this mountain.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_93' name='Page_93' href='#Page_93'>93</a></span>
He was, of course, exultant. The inhabitants of the
valley had told him that the conquest of the Romsdalhorn
was hopeless, and no tradition existed among them that its
ascent had ever been made. Nevertheless, when the successful
climber finally stood upon the mountain's crest, he found
to his astonishment and regret that he was not the first
man who had gained this victory. A mound of stones,
heaped up there as a monument, proved beyond doubt that
at some unknown epoch some one had been there before him.

<p>
Driving around the base of this majestic mountain, we
found ourselves within a narrow gorge shut in by savage
cliffs, with barely space enough between them for the carriage-road
and a wild torrent rushing toward the sea. One wall of
this ravine is singularly weird and
awe-inspiring. A multitude
of crags and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_94' name='Page_94' href='#Page_94'>94</a></span>
pinnacles, splintered and shattered by the lightning's bolts,
stand out in sharp relief against the sky, as if some monsters,
hidden on the other side, were raising o'er the brink of these
stupendous precipices their outstretched hands and tapering
fingers in warning or in supplication. These strange, fantastic
forms are in the evening light so ghostly and uncanny, that they
appear to the Norwegian peasants like demons dancing gleefully
upon the
mountain tops.
Hence the pinnacles
are called
the "Witches'
Peaks."

<p>
It was while
riding through
this gorge that
I heard a tourist
complaining
that Norway
had no ruins.
In one sense
this is true, for,
owing to the fact
that the feudal system never existed here, castles and strongholds
are nowhere to be found. But Norway surely can dispense
with any crumbling works of man. Amidst the ruins
of her everlasting mountains and stupendous fjords, grooved
by the glaciers when the earth was young, all remnants
of man's handiwork would seem like ant-hills made but an
hour ago.
</p>

<p>
Toward evening, at the head of the Romsdal Valley, we
reached the station of Stuflaaten, where we were to sleep.
Our spirits sank as we approached it. Nothing, apparently,
could be less inviting. But here, as in so many other instances,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_95' name='Page_95' href='#Page_95'>95</a></span>
we found the
accommodations
excellent. It is
true, the beds
possessed the
usual Norwegian
fault—an insufficient
length.
Tall travelers,
who object to
having their
limbs closed
under them at
night, like the blades of a jack-knife, frequently sleep on
the floor in Norway.

<p>
Never shall I forget the dining-room at Stuflaaten. Here
we were first attracted by the fireplace. It was a chimney
built out from the corner, with space behind for a warm cupboard.
The
opening for fuel
was so narrow
that sticks were
placed upright
upon the hearth.
Beside this were
two rocking-chairs
(almost
unheard of luxuries
in any part
of Europe), and
sinking into
these, we thought
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_96' name='Page_96' href='#Page_96'>96</a></span>
of home. The influence of that American article of furniture
was, I fear, depressing, for soon my friend remarked:
</p>

<p>
"How far we are from dear New England! If I could
only see one object here which really came from there, how
happy I should be!"
</p>

<p>
"Look at that clock upon the wall," I responded; "that
has a familiar look. Perhaps that came from 'dear New
England!'"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," he answered; "how could anything made
in New England
find its way here
almost within the
Arctic circle?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," I exclaimed,
"where
is the land that
Yankee inventions
have not
entered? Let us
put it to the
test." Accordingly,
stepping to the clock, I opened it and read these words:
"Made by Jerome &amp; Co., New Haven, Conn."
</p>

<p>
Returning once more through the Romsdal, Veblungsnäs,
and Molde, we sailed again, for twelve hours, along the Norway
coast to reach the city of Trondhjem. Although less beautifully
situated than Bergen, Molde, or Christiania, in point of
historic interest, Trondhjem is superior to them all. For here
lived the old Norwegian kings, and the town can boast of a continuous
existence for a thousand years. It also enjoys the proud
distinction of having the most northern railway station in the
world, for from this city, which is in the latitude of Iceland,
a railroad now extends three hundred and fifty miles southward
to Christiania.

<p>
Upon this road are run some
cars which are facetiously called
"sleepers"; but they are such as
Mr. George M. Pullman would see only in
an acute attack of nightmare. The road
being a narrow-gauge one, the car is not much wider than an
omnibus. The berth (if the name can be applied to such a
coffin-like contrivance) is formed by pulling narrow cushion-seats
together. On these is placed one pillow, but no blanket
and no mattress,—simply a pillow,—nothing more! From the
feeling, I should say that my pillow consisted of a small boulder
covered with cotton. But what, think you, is the upper berth?
It is a hammock, swung on hooks, and sagging down to within
a foot of the lower couch. Now, it requires some skill to get
into a hammock anywhere; but to climb into one that is hung
four feet above the floor of a moving railroad car, calls for the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_98' name='Page_98' href='#Page_98'>98</a></span>
agility of an acrobat. After my experience that night, I feel
perfectly qualified to perform on the trapeze, for since I weighed
but one hundred and forty pounds, while my friend tipped the
scales at two
hundred and
fifty, I thought
it was safer for
me to occupy
the upper story.

<p>
Another difficulty
met with
in that memorable
journey was
to keep covered
up. There was
no heat in the car. At every respiration, we could see our
breath. This was, however, a consolation, since it assured
us that we were still alive. Wraps of all kinds were needed,
but the space was limited. There was, for example, in my
hammock, room for myself alone; or without me, for my
traveling-rug, overcoat, and pillow. But when we were
all in together, the hammock was continually overflowing.
Accordingly, every fifteen minutes during that awful night,
my friend would start up in abject terror, dreaming that he
was being buried beneath a Norway avalanche.
</p>

<p>
I never think of Trondhjem without recalling, also, an
experience in a Norwegian barber-shop. I knew that it was
tempting Providence to enter it, for shaving in Norway is
still a kind of surgical operation. But for some time a coldness
had existed between my razors and myself. The edge
of our friendship had become dulled. Accordingly, I made
the venture. Before me, as I entered, stood a man with a
head of hair like Rubenstein's, and a mouth like a miniature
fjord.

The preliminaries being over, the Norwegian Figaro
took his razor and made one
awful never-to-be-forgotten
swoop at my cheek as if he
were mowing grain with a

He seemed to understand me, and retreated to a corner.
When all was over, he pointed to a bowl at which I saw
my friend gazing with that peculiarly sad expression which he
invariably assumed when thinking of his family. I soon discovered
the cause, for from the centre of this wash-bowl rose
a little fountain about a foot in height, which seemed to
him a facsimile of the one on Boston Common. I comprehended
that I was to wash in this fountain; but how to do
it was a mystery. At last I cautiously thrust one side of my
face into it, and instantly the water shot up over my ear and
fell upon the other side. I turned my face, and the ascending
current carromed on my nose, ran down my neck, and made
a change of toilet absolutely necessary. When, therefore,
my friend had called a cab to take me home, I asked the
barber what I should pay him. By gestures he expressed to
me the sum equivalent to three cents.
</p>

<p>
"What," I exclaimed, "nothing extra for the court-plaster?"
</p>

This city of the north has one extremely interesting
building—its cathedral. As a rule, Scandinavian churches are
not worth a visit; but this is a notable exception. More
than three hundred years before Columbus landed on San
Salvador this building held a proud position. Its finest carving
dates from the eleventh century. At one time pilgrims
came here from all northern Europe, and laid their gold and
jewels on its shrines. But at the period of the Reformation all
this was changed. Iconoclasts defaced its carving, cast down
its statues, sacked the church, and packed its treasures in a
ship, which, as if cursed by an offended Deity, foundered
at sea.

<p>
On entering the ancient edifice, we were delighted with its
delicate stone-tracing. The material is a bluish slate, which
gives to the whole church a softness and a beauty difficult to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_104' name='Page_104' href='#Page_104'>104</a></span>
equal, and blends most admirably with its columns of white
marble. A part of the cathedral was, however, closed to us,
for all the ruin once wrought here is being carefully effaced
by systematic restoration. The government contributes for
this purpose a certain
sum every year, and private
individuals help on
the work from genuine
love of art, as well as from
patriotic motives. The
old designs are being followed,
and hence, in time, this old
cathedral will in every feature come to be a reproduction of
the original structure.

A few days after reaching Trondhjem, we found ourselves
embarking for another ocean journey. This time our destination
was the northern limit of the continent. For a Norwegian
tour naturally divides itself into three parts. The first
consists of driving through the mountainous interior; the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_105' name='Page_105' href='#Page_105'>105</a></span>
second is the exploration
of its
noble fjords;
the third is the
voyage from
Trondhjem to
the North Cape.

<p class="caption">AN EXCURSION STEAMER.</p>
</div>

<p>
This voyage,
in fast excursion
steamers, is now
made in about four days, an equal number being occupied in
returning. "Eight days?" the reader will perhaps exclaim;
"why, that is longer than a voyage across the Atlantic." In
actual duration, yes; but otherwise the two excursions are
entirely different. For almost all the way you follow so
closely the fringe of islands that there is little danger of
rough weather, while the mainland is constantly in sight.

<p class="caption">ONE OF THE LOFFODENS.</p>
</div>

<p>
Some twenty-four hours after leaving Trondhjem, our
steamer halted at an island, up whose precipitous side we
climbed five hundred feet to view a natural tunnel perforating
an entire mountain. Through this we gained a charming
telescopic vista of the ocean and its island belt. The tunnel
is six hundred feet in length, and in some places two hundred
feet in height. So smooth and perpendicular are its
walls, that it appears almost incredible that human agency
has not assisted
in this strange
formation. But
scientists say
that it was
accomplished
entirely by the
waves, when all
this rock-bound
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_106' name='Page_106' href='#Page_106'>106</a></span>
coast was covered by the sea. Leaving this curious freak of
nature, another memorable feature of our northern voyage
soon greeted us,—the Loffoden Islands. These form a
broken chain one hundred and thirty miles in length. The
scenery in their vicinity is perhaps the finest on the Norway
coast, and as we watched it with delight, the captain told us
of his voyages here in winter, and I now learned, to my astonishment
that freight-steamers make their regular trips, all
winter long, round the North Cape to Vadso, on the Arctic
coast. They encounter fearful storms at times, but rarely any
icebergs. We have, it seems, a monopoly of these floating
monsters on our side of the Atlantic, borne west and south
by the current off the coast of Greenland.

Of course, these wintry voyages are performed in darkness,
for Night then reigns here with as much supremacy as

kept constantly burning. Yet, strange to say, this is the
period of greatest activity among these islands. Winter is the
Norwegian fisherman's harvest-time. The only light necessary

<p class="caption">TROMSÖ.</p>
</div>

<p>
Soon after leaving the Loffodens we arrived at Tromsö,
the city of the Lapps. It had the appearance of a pretty
village as we viewed it from a distance; but soon the sense
of sight was wholly lost in the prominence given to another
of our senses. The carcass of a whale was floating in
the harbor. It had been speared and towed in hither to be
cut in pieces. The blubber was being
boiled in kettles on the shore. The
impression which this made on my
olfactory nerves is something for which
language is inadequate. The odor was
as colossal as the fish itself. I never
sympathized sufficiently with Jonah till
I went to Tromsö!

<p class="caption">LAPLANDERS.</p>
</div>

<p>
Soon after landing here, a walk of
an hour brought us to a settlement of
Lapps, consisting of some very primitive
tents. My first impression of these
people was, and still is, that any one of
them could have effectually concealed
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_110' name='Page_110' href='#Page_110'>110</a></span>
his identity by
taking a bath.
They all have
dirty, wizened faces, high cheekbones, flat noses, and mouths
that yawn like caverns. Their beards are so peculiarly tufted
that they look like worn-out Astrachan fur. I could almost
suppose that in rigorous winters the reindeer, while their masters
slept, had nibbled at their cheeks. The men are about
five feet high, the women four;
but they are tough and hardy,
like most dwarfs. Dickens
could have found among them
countless models for his hideous
Quilp.

<p>
Advancing to one of their
huts, we peered into the interior.
Upon the ground was
smoldering a small fire, part
of the smoke from which escaped
through an opening in
the roof. The inmates scarcely
noticed us, until my artist produced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_111' name='Page_111' href='#Page_111'>111</a></span>
his camera. Then there was instantly a general stampede.
One woman seized her baby and rushed forth, as if a demon
had molested her. The cause of this confusion, however, was
not fear, nor even modesty, but avarice, pure and simple.
They understood perfectly what the camera was, and wanted
a good price for being photographed. Three shillings was
at first demanded for a picture, but finally we compromised
by giving half that sum.
</p>

<p class="caption">LIFE IN LAPLAND.</p>
</div>

<p>
Among these Laplanders, the clothing of both men and
women is made of reindeer skin, worn with the hardened pelt
outside. These garments last indefinitely, and are sometimes
bequeathed from one generation to another. The Lapp complexion
looks like leather. Even the babies have a shriveled
look, resembling that of monkeys. This is not strange, however,
for both men and women are great consumers of
tobacco. Their huts are always full of smoke, till finally the
inmates become smoke-dried within and without. This, in
turn, produces thirst. Hence we were not surprised to learn
that they are inordinately fond of ardent spirits. In fact,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_112' name='Page_112' href='#Page_112'>112</a></span>
when a Norwegian wishes to remonstrate with a friend who is
inclined to drink to excess, he will often say to him, "Don't
make a Lapp of yourself!"
</p>

<p>
Bidding farewell to Tromsö and the Laplanders, the next
day brought us to the most northern town in the world—Hammerfest.
It was a great surprise to me to see, in such
proximity to the North Pole, a town of about three thousand
inhabitants, with schools, a church, a telegraph station, and a
weekly newspaper! The snow-streaked mountains in the distance
gave me the only hint of winter that I had; and I could
hardly realize that I was here two hundred miles farther north
than Bering's Strait, and in about the same latitude in which,
on our side of the Atlantic, the gallant Sir John Franklin
perished in the ice. The cause of this, however, is not difficult
to trace.

<p>
The influence of the Gulf Stream is felt powerfully
even here. For here it is that the great ocean current practically
dies, bequeathing to these fishermen of Hammerfest, for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_113' name='Page_113' href='#Page_113'>113</a></span>
their firewood, the treasures it has so long carried on its bosom,
such as the trunks of palm-trees, and the vegetation of the
tropics. It is an
extraordinary
fact that while
the harbor of
Christiania, one
thousand miles
farther south,
is frozen over
three months
every winter,
this bay of Hammerfest, only sixty miles from the North
Cape, is never closed on account of ice.

<p>
An interesting object in Hammerfest is the meridian shaft,
which marks the number of degrees between this town and
the mouth of the Danube, on the Black Sea. The mention
made upon this column of that
other terminus of measurement,
so far distant in the
South of Europe, reminded us
by contrast of one more advantage
which this high latitude
possesses—the greater
rapidity of its vegetation.
When the sun once appears
within this polar region, it
comes to stay. Nature immediately
makes amends for
her long seclusion. For three
months the sunshine is well-nigh
incessant. There is no
loss of time at night. The flowers do not close in sleep. All
vegetation rushes to maturity. Thus vegetables in the Arctic

circle will sometimes grow three inches in a single day, and

they are ready for the table at the same time.

<p>
Sailing finally from Hammerfest, a voyage of seven hours
brought us to our destination—the North Cape. I looked
upon it with that
passionate eagerness
born of long
years of anticipation,
and felt at
once a thrill of
satisfaction, in
the absence of
all disappointment.
For my
ideal of that
famous promontory
could not be
more perfectly
realized than
in this dark-browed,
majestic
headland, rising with perpendicular cliffs, one thousand feet
in height, from the still darker ocean at its base. It is, in
reality, an island, divided from the mainland by a narrow
strait, like a gigantic sentinel stationed in advance to guard
the coast of Europe from the Arctic storms.

<p class="caption">HARBOR OF HAMMERFEST.</p>
</div>

<p>
Embarking here in boats, we drew still nearer to this
monstrous cliff. From this point it resembles a stupendous
fortress surmounted by an esplanade. For in that prehistoric
age, when northern Europe was enveloped in an icy
mantle, huge glaciers in their southward march planed down
its summit to a level surface. The climbing of the cliff,
though safe, is quite exhausting. Ropes are, however, hung

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_115' name='Page_115' href='#Page_115'></a></span>
at different points, and, holding on to these, we slowly crept
up to its southern parapet. Thence a laborious walk of fifteen
minutes brought us at last to the highest elevation,
marked by a granite monument erected to commemorate
King Oscar's visit to the place in 1873.
</p>

<p>
It is a wonderfully impressive moment when one stands
thus on the northern boundary of Europe, so near and yet so
far from the North Pole. It seemed to me as if the outermost
limit of our planet had been reached. Nowhere, not
even in the desert, have I felt so utterly remote from civilization,
or so near to the infinitude of space.

<p>
But presently from our steamer, anchored near the base,
some rockets rose and burst in fiery showers far below us. It
was a signal for us to be on our guard. I looked at my
watch. It was exactly five minutes before midnight. Advancing,
therefore, to the edge of the cliff, I looked upon a unique
and never-to-be-forgotten scene. Below, beyond me, and on
either side, lay in sublime and awful
solitude the Arctic sea,
stretching away
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_118' name='Page_118' href='#Page_118'>118</a></span>
to that still undiscovered
region
of the
north, which,
with its fatal
charm, has lured
so many brave
explorers to
their doom.

<p>
Straight from
the polar sea,
apparently, the
wondrous northern
light (an
opalescent radiance
born of the twilight and the dawn) came stealing o'er
the waters like a benediction; and to enhance its mystery
and beauty, when I looked northward over the rounded
shoulder of the
globe, I saw the

At this great
height and
northern latitude
it did not
sink to the horizon,
but merely
paused, apparently
some twenty
feet above the
waves, then
gradually rose
again. It was
the last of countless
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_119' name='Page_119' href='#Page_119'>119</a></span>
sunsets which had that day been following each other
round the globe. It was the first of countless sunrises which,
hour after hour, in so many continents would wake to life
again a sleeping world. I have seen many impressive sights
in many lands, but nothing, until Time for me shall be no
more, can equal in solemnity the hour when, standing on this
threshold of a continent, and on the edge of this immeasurable
sea, I watched, without one moment's interval of darkness,
the Past transform itself into the Present, and Yesterday
become To-day.

coats of mail, and towering up among the clouds as though to
storm the very heights of Heaven. If it be true, as some

</div>

<p>
Switzerland, then, of all countries in the world, is the one
of which the traveler is likely to tire least. The vision of its
kingly Alps must always thrill the heart with exultation. Its
noble roads and unsurpassed hotels make rest or travel on its
heights delightful; while the keen tonic of its mountain air
restores the jaded frame, as ancients dreamed a draught would
do from the pure fountain of perpetual youth.
</p>

<p>
One of the most attractive gateways to this land of mountains
is Interlaken. All tourists in Switzerland come hither,
almost of necessity. No other point is quite so central for
excursions. None is more easy of approach. As its name
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_125' name='Page_125' href='#Page_125'>125</a></span>
indicates, it lies between two famous lakes which rival one
another in respect to beauty. Before it, also, are the charming
vales of Lauterbrunnen and Grindelwald, which lead one
into the very heart of the Bernese Oberland. Moreover, from
sixty to eighty thousand people come here every year to
render homage to the peerless sovereign who holds court at
Interlaken. There is no need to name the peak to which I
thus allude, for everywhere in Interlaken we discern the crowning
glory of the place—beside which all others fade—the
lovely Jungfrau, queen of Alpine heights. Her grand,
resplendent form fills the entire space between the encircling
peaks, and forms a dazzling centre-piece of ice and snow,
nearly fourteen thousand feet in height. It is a never-ending
pleasure to rest upon the broad piazzas of Interlaken's palatial
hotels, and gaze upon this radiant mount. It sometimes
looks like a great white cloud forever anchored in one place, but
oftener sparkles as if covered with a robe of diamonds; mantled,
as it is, with snows of virgin purity from base to heaven-piercing
summit.

<p>
Yet were we to examine closely a single section of the
Jungfrau, we should discover that its shoulders are covered
with enormous snow-fields, the origin of stupendous avalanches.
For amid all this beauty there is much here that
is harsh and terrible. Appalling precipices, dangerous crevasses,
and well-nigh constant falls of hundreds of tons of rock
and ice, render the wooing of this "Maiden of the Alps" a
difficult undertaking. In fact, the name Jungfrau, or Maiden,
was given to the mountain, because its pure summit seemed
destined to remain forever virgin to the tread of man. Many
had sought to make her conquest, but in vain. At last, however,
in 1811 (nearly thirty years after the subjugation of
Mont Blanc), two brothers gained the crest; and since that
time its icy slopes have reflected the forms of many ambitious
and courageous travelers.
</p>

<p>
No tourist who has been at Interlaken on a pleasant evening
can possibly forget the vision which presents itself as
day reluctantly retires from the Jungfrau at the approach of
night.

I have said that Interlaken was an admirable place from
which to make excursions. Shall we not put this to the proof
by entering now the charming and romantic vale of Lauterbrunnen,
dainty and lovely as a dimple in the cheek of Nature?
It is only half a mile in width, and is bounded on both sides by
lofty mountains, over which the winter's sun can hardly climb
till midday. And yet luxuriant vegetation covers it, as with
an emerald carpet. The bases of these mountains seem to rest
on flowers. The awful scenery which surrounds it makes it seem
doubly sweet and fair; and one can hardly imagine a more
striking picture than that of this
peaceful valley, looking smilingly
up into the stern and savage faces
of the monsters which environ it,
as if unconscious of its helplessness,
or trusting confidently in
their mercy.

<p>
A little distance
up the valley, we
note its most remarkable
feature,
the Fall of the
Staubbach, or
"Dust-brook,"
which here leaps
boldly over the
brow of the
mountain,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_132' name='Page_132' href='#Page_132'>132</a></span>
nine hundred and
eighty feet above us.
Long before it reaches
the ground, it is converted
into a vast,
diaphanous cloud of
spray, which the
breeze scatters into
thousands of fantastic
wreaths. Whenever
the sunlight streams
directly through this,
the effect is marvelous.
It then resembles a
transparent veil of silvery
lace, woven with
all the colors of the rainbow, fluttering from the fir-clad
rocks. Byron compared it to the tail of a white horse,
streaming in the wind; but
Goethe's description is best,
when he exclaims:

The task is
easily accomplished
now.
Ten years ago
it was an arduous
climb, on
horseback or on
foot; but now
an electric railroad
winds for
miles along the
edge of frightful
precipices, and (where a vertical ascent is absolutely necessary)
another kind of car lifts one a thousand feet or so
toward heaven, as smoothly and as swiftly as a hotel elevator.

<p class="caption">MODERN ALPINE CLIMBING.</p>
</div>

<p>
Truly the visitor of a dozen years ago perceives amazing
changes to-day among the Alps. Where, formerly, a man
would hardly dare to go on foot, trains now ascend with myriads
of travelers! Hotels
and even railroad stations
up among the clouds have
driven from the lofty
crags the eagle and the
chamois. This to the
genuine Alpine climber
seems like sacrilege; but,
after all, what contributors
to the happiness of
mankind these mountain
railroads are! Without
them, few would venture
here; and all the pageantry
of Nature in
these upper regions
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_136' name='Page_136' href='#Page_136'>136</a></span>
would unfold itself through the revolving years with scarce an
eye to note its beauty or voice to tell its glories to the world.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">MÜRREN.</p>
</div>

<p>
In startling contrast to my first ascent to the place, now
many years ago,
it was by this
luxurious mode
of travel that I
recently approached
the
little village
known as Mürren.
It is the
loftiest hamlet
in all Switzerland,
consisting
of a cluster
of Swiss cottages,
whose
roofs, heavily
freighted with protecting stones, project beyond the walls like
broad-brimmed hats. So singular is the appearance of a
village at this dizzy height, that one is tempted to believe
that the houses had been blown up from the valley by
some reckless blast, and dropped at random on the lonely
tableland.
</p>

<p>
Yet here, to our astonishment, we find hotels, which somehow
year by year outlive the horrors of the Alpine winter,
and in the summer season welcome their hundreds of adventurous
guests. But, after all, where in Switzerland is there
not a hotel? Fast as the arteries of travel are extended, on
every prominent point commanding a fine view is planted
a hotel, a forerunner of the world of travel. This is, in fact,
one of the charms of Switzerland. The Andes and Himalayas
may possess higher peaks and grander glaciers; but there one
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_137' name='Page_137' href='#Page_137'>137</a></span>
cannot (as among the Alps) ride all day long on perfect roads,
and in the evening sit down to a well-cooked dinner, hear
music on a broad veranda, consult the latest newspapers, and
sleep in a comfortable bed.
</p>

<p>
Even before the advent of the railroad, I was a thousandfold
repaid for climbing up to Mürren; for here so closely
do the Alpine Titans press on every side, that if Mohammed
had ever found his way hither, he might well have believed
that the mountains were coming to him, and not he to the
mountains.
</p>

<p class="caption">A HOTEL AT MÜRREN.</p>
</div>

<p>
The surrounding summits reveal to the astonished sight
heights, lengths, and depths which overwhelm one with sublimity.
What seemed an hour ago mere glistening mounds
are now transformed by the grandeur of this Olympian elevation
into vast
snowfields, miles
in length, or
into seas of ice,
which pour
down through
the valleys in
slow-moving
floods. In early
summer, too,
one hears at
frequent intervals
the roar of
some tremendous
avalanche
on the great
mountains opposite,
from which the tourist is separated only by a yawning gulf.
</p>

<p>
Never shall I forget the morning when I stood here waiting
for the sunrise view. There was none of that crowd of jabbering
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_138' name='Page_138' href='#Page_138'>138</a></span>
tourists who often profane the summit of the Rigi, and
seem to measure the extent of their pleasure by the noise they
make. I was well-nigh alone. When I emerged from the
hotel, a purple line was visible in the east, but clouds and
mists half veiled the mountains from my sight. At length,
however, noiselessly but steadily, a hidden hand seemed
to draw back the misty curtain of the night. Slowly the
giant forms molded themselves from darkness into light,
until their foreheads first, and then each fold and outline
of their dazzling shapes, stood forth in bold relief against the
sky. The glaciers sparkled with the first bright beams like
jeweled highways of the gods,—till, finally, as the sun's
disk came fairly into view, the whole vast range glowed like a
wall of tinted porcelain. It seemed as if a thousand sacred
fires had been kindled on these mountain altars, in glad
response to the triumphant greeting of the god of day.
</p>

<p>
On descending from Mürren, the tourist is attracted to
another famous object, only a few miles from Interlaken,—the
glacier of Grindelwald.

<p>
It was while visiting this sea of ice that my guide suddenly
turned and asked me with a smile, "Are you a clergyman?"
</p>

<p>
I answered that I could not claim that flattering distinction,
but begged to know the reason of his question.
"Because," he said, "clergymen seem to be unlucky in
Grindelwald; all
the accidents
that take place
here somehow
happen to
them."
</p>

<p>
As we were
at that moment
just about to
venture on the
ice, I naturally
recalled Charles
Lamb's reply
when he was requested
to say
grace at dinner.
"What," he
exclaimed, "are there no clergymen present? Then I will
say, the Lord be thanked!"
</p>

<p>
A moment or two later we entered the well-known cavern
in this glacier—a strange and chilling passageway, two hundred
feet in length, cut in the solid ice, whose gleaming walls
and roof seemed to be made of polished silver.
</p>

</div>

<p>
As I was picking my way safely, though shiveringly,
through this huge refrigerator, I asked my guide to tell me about
one of the clerical misfortunes which had made him suspicious
of gentlemen of the cloth. He turned and looked at me
curiously. "You know, of course, the fate of our pastor,
M. Mouron?" he exclaimed. I confessed my ignorance.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_142' name='Page_142' href='#Page_142'>142</a></span>
"Then come with me,"
he said. Accordingly,
emerging from the cavern,
we climbed for nearly an
hour over great blocks of
ice, until we came to a profound
abyss. Suspended
from the frozen parapet a
mass of icicles pointed mysteriously
down like ghostly
fingers. Then all was dark.
"It was by falling down
this," said the guide,
"that the pastor of
Grindelwald lost his life.
He was seeking one day to
ascertain its depth by casting stones into its cavernous maw
and counting till he heard the sound of their arrival at the
bottom of the
abyss. Once, in
his eagerness,
he placed his
staff against the
opposite edge,
leaned over and
listened. Suddenly
the ice
gave way, and
he fell headlong
into the
crevasse. His
guide ran
breathless to
the village and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_143' name='Page_143' href='#Page_143'>143</a></span>
informed the people of their loss. But, to his horror, he
found that he himself was looked upon with suspicion. In
fact, some went so far as to say that he must have murdered
their pastor, and robbed him of his watch and purse.
</p>

<p>
"The guides of Grindelwald, however, who felt themselves
insulted at this accusation, united and agreed that one
of their number (chosen by lot) should, at the peril of his life,
descend into this crevasse to establish the innocence of the
accused. The lot was drawn by
one of the bravest of them all, a
man named Bergenen. The whole
village assembled on the flood of
ice to witness the result of the search. After partaking of
the sacrament, Bergenen fastened a rope around his waist
and a lantern to his neck. In one hand he took a bell.
In the other he grasped his iron-pointed staff to keep himself
from the sharp edges. Four men then carefully lowered
him down. Twice, on the point of suffocation, he rang the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_144' name='Page_144' href='#Page_144'>144</a></span>
bell and was
drawn up. Finally
a heavier
weight was felt
upon the rope,
and Bergenen reappeared,
bringing the body
of the pastor
from a depth of
seven hundred
and fifty feet.
A mighty shout
went up from the guides and populace as well. The man
was innocent. Both watch and purse were found upon the
corpse!"

<p>
As we returned from Grindelwald to Interlaken, we often
paused to note the peasants toiling in the fields. So far as their
appearance was concerned, we might have supposed them laborers
on a Vermont farm; but their low carts were quite unlike
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_145' name='Page_145' href='#Page_145'>145</a></span>
our country hayracks; and the appearance of a single ox,
harnessed with ropes around his horns, presented an amusing
contrast to the sturdy beasts which, bound together by the
yoke, drag to our barns their loads of fragrant hay. Women,
of course, were working with the men; but female laborers
in Switzerland are not in the majority. In many instances
the ratio is but
one to three.
</p>

<p class="caption">A SWISS FARM-HOUSE.</p>
</div>

<p>
These peasants
look up
curiously as we
drive along,
and no doubt
think that we
are favored beings,
to whom
our luxuries
give perfect
happiness. And
yet the very
tourists whom
they thus envy
may, in a single
hour, endure more misery and heartache than they in their
simplicity and moderate poverty will ever know. Among
these people are not found the framers of those hopeless
questions: "Is life worth living?" and "Does death end
all?" The real destroyers of life's happiness are not a
lowly home and manual labor. They are the constant worriments
and cares of artificial life,—satiety of pleasures, the
overwork of mental powers, and the disenchantment of satisfied
desires.
</p>

<p>
Filled with such thoughts, as we beheld the humble but
well-kept and ever picturesque dwellings of the farmers of this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_146' name='Page_146' href='#Page_146'>146</a></span>
valley, I called to mind, as a consoling antidote to one's first
natural sympathy with poverty, the story of the sultan who,
despite all his wealth and power, was always melancholy.
He had been told by his physician that, if he would be cured
of all his real or fancied ailments, he must exchange shirts
with the first
perfectly happy
man he could
find. Out went
his officers in
search of such
a person.

<p>
The hunt
was long and
arduous, but
finally the fortunate
being
was found.
When he was
brought to the
sultan, however,
it was discovered,
alas! that this perfectly happy individual was not the
possessor of a shirt.

<p class="caption">MOUNT PILATE FROM LUCERNE.</p>
</div>

<p>
From Interlaken, every tourist makes a short excursion
to one of the best known of Alpine waterfalls,—the Giessbach.
Set in a glorious framework of dark trees, it leaves the cliff,
one thousand feet above, and in a series of cascades leaps
downward to the lake. If this descending torrent were
endowed with consciousness, I fancy it would be as wretched
in its present state as a captive lion in a cage, continually
stared at by a curious multitude. For never was a cascade
so completely robbed of liberty and privacy as this. A pathway
crosses it repeatedly by means of bridges, and seems to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_149' name='Page_149' href='#Page_149'>149</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_148' name='Page_148' href='#Page_148'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_147' name='Page_147' href='#Page_147'></a></span>
bind it to the mountain as with a winding chain. Behind it
are numerous galleries where visitors may view it from the
rear. Arbors and seats are also placed on either side; and thus,
through every hour of the day, people to right of it, people
to left of it, people in rear of it, people in front of it, look
on and wonder. Even at night it has but little rest; for hardly
have the shadows shrouded it, when it is torn from its obscurity
by torches, calcium lights, and fireworks, which all along
its course reveal it to the admiring crowd in a kaleidoscope
of colors.

<p>
Far happier, therefore, seems another waterfall of Switzerland,—the
Reichenbach; for this is left comparatively undisturbed
within
its mountain
solitude. Far
off, upon a
mountain crest,
a blue lake, set
like a sapphire
amid surrounding
glaciers,
serves as a cradle
for this new-born
river.
Thence it
emerges, timidly
at first, to
make its way
down to the
outer world. With each descent, however, it gains fresh impetus
and courage. Return is now impossible. The die is
cast. Its fate is now decided. We almost wish that we could
check its course amid this beautiful environment. It will not
find a sweeter or a safer place. Too soon it will be forced to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_150' name='Page_150' href='#Page_150'>150</a></span>
bear great burdens,
turn countless
wheels, and
minister to thousands.
Then, at
the last, will
come old Ocean's
cold and passionless

Another portal to this land of mountains, rivaling Interlaken
in attractiveness, is Lucerne, reclining peacefully beside
its noble lake. I do not know a resting-place in Switzerland
which is in all respects so satisfying as this.

Its hotels are among the finest in the world; the town
itself is pretty and attractive; and in the foreground is a
panorama too varied to become monotonous, too beautiful
ever to lose its charm. Mount Pilate and the Rigi guard
Lucerne like sentinels, the one on the east, the other on the
west, like halting-places for the morning
and the evening stars.
Directly opposite,
upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_151' name='Page_151' href='#Page_151'>151</a></span>
the southern boundary of the lake, miles upon miles of
snow-capped mountains rise against the sky, as if to indicate
the limit of the world.

</div>

<p>
One of the sentinels of Lucerne, as I have said, is Mount
Pilate. Toward this the faces of all tourists turn, as to a
huge barometer; for by its
cap of
clouds Pilate foretells the
weather which excursionists
must look for. There is
hardly need to recall the
popular derivation of the
mountain's name. It was in olden times believed that Pontius
Pilate, in his wanderings through the world, impelled at
last by horror and remorse, committed suicide upon its
summit. On this account the mountain was considered
haunted. At one time the town authorities even forbade
people to ascend it on a Friday! But now there is a hotel
on the top, and every day in the week, Friday included, a
railway train climbs resolutely to the summit, enabling
thousands to enjoy every summer a view scarcely to be surpassed
in grandeur or extent at any point among the Alps.
No allusion to Lucerne would be complete without reference
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_152' name='Page_152' href='#Page_152'>152</a></span>
to that noble product of Thorwaldsen's genius, which, in
more respects than one, is the lion of the place. It is difficult
to imagine a more appropriate memorial than this, of the
fidelity and valor exhibited one hundred years ago by the
Swiss guard, who in defense of Louis XVI laid down their
lives at the opening of the French Revolution.
No view does justice to this famous
statue. Within a
monstrous niche,
which has been hollowed
out of a perpendicular
cliff, reclines,
as in some
mountain cave, the
prostrate figure of a
lion, thirty feet in
length. It is evident
that the animal has
received a mortal
wound. The handle
of a spear protrudes
from his side. Yet
even in the agony of
death he guards the
Bourbon shield and
lily, which he has
given his life to defend.
One paw protects
them; his
drooping head caresses them, and gives to them a
mute farewell. Beneath the figure, chiseled in the
rock, are the names of the officers murdered by the mob;
while above is the brief but eloquent inscription: "To the
fidelity and bravery of the Swiss." In the whole world I
do not know of a monument more simple yet impressive.

One of the
greatest pleasures
of the tourist
in Lucerne is to
sail out, as he
may do at almost
any hour of the
day, upon its
lovely lake.
This, in respect
to scenery, surpasses
all its
Alpine rivals.
Twenty-three
miles in length,
it has the form
of a gigantic cross, each arm of which (when looked upon in the
glow of sunset from a neighboring height) seems like a plain
of gold and lapis-lazuli
set in a frame-work of majestic
mountains. No tour
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_154' name='Page_154' href='#Page_154'>154</a></span>
in Switzerland
is complete
without a sail
upon this fair
expanse of
water. Hence
more than half
a million travelers
cross it
every year during
the summer
months alone,
and tiny steamers are continually visible, cutting their furrows
on its smooth, transparent surface, as sharply as a diamond
marks a pane of glass.

Moreover, when the boat glides inward toward the shore,
one sees that other elements of beauty are not wanting here.
Pretty chalets with overhanging roofs; rich pastures, orchards,
and gardens,—all these, with numerous villages, succeed each
other here for miles, between
the lake and the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_157' name='Page_157' href='#Page_157'>157</a></span>

bold cliffs that rise toward Heaven. Nor is this all. The
villages possess a history, since these romantic shores were
formerly the stage on which Swiss patriots performed those
thrilling scenes immortalized by Schiller in his drama of
"William Tell."
</p>

<p class="caption">ALTAR IN TELL'S CHAPEL.</p>
</div>

<p>
In fact, at one point half concealed among the trees is the
well-known structure, called Tell's Chapel. It stands upon
the spot where, it is said, the hero, springing from the tyrant's
boat, escaped the
clutches of the Austrian
governor. As is well
known, doubts have been
cast on even the existence
of this national chieftain;
and yet it is beyond peradventure
that a chapel
was erected here to his
memory as early as the
fifteenth century, and only
eleven years ago this structure
was restored at government
expense. Moreover,
once a year at least,
the people of the neighboring
cantons gather here
in great numbers to celebrate a festival which has been held
by their ancestors for centuries.
</p>

<p>
The little building is certainly well calculated to awaken
patriotism. Appropriate frescoes, representing exploits ascribed
to William Tell, adorn the walls; while opposite the
doorway is an altar at which religious services are held. How
solemn and impressive must the ceremony be, when religious
rites are performed in such a historic and picturesque locality
in the presence of a reverent multitude! At such a time this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_158' name='Page_158' href='#Page_158'>158</a></span>
tiny shrine may be considered part of the sublime cathedral
of the mountains, whose columns are majestic trees, whose
stained glass is autumnal foliage, whose anthems are the songs
of birds, whose requiems are the moaning of the pines, and
whose grand roof is the stupendous arch of the unmeasured
sky, beneath which the snow-clad mountains rise like jeweled
altars, lighted at night, as if with lofty tapers, by the glittering
stars.

But to appreciate the beauty of this sheet of water, one
should behold it when its surface is unruffled by a breeze. Enamoured
of their own beauty, the mountains then look down
into the lake as into an incomparable mirror. It is an inverted
world. The water is as transparent as the sky. The very
breezes hold their breath, lest they should mar the exquisite
reflection. The neighboring peaks display their rugged features
in this limpid flood, as if unconscious of the wrinkles
which betray their age. The pine trees stand so motionless
upon the shore that they appear like slender ferns. Instinctively
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_159' name='Page_159' href='#Page_159'>159</a></span>

man's triumphant
victory
over obstacles,
in the formation of its roads. Despite their great cost of
construction these prove profitable investments; for the better
the roads, the more people will travel over them. Referring
to them, some one has prettily said, that by such means the

How great
the difference
between the
Switzerland of
to-day and that

picked their precarious way through mud or snow, luxurious
landaus now roll easily
along, on thoroughfares
of rock, without a stone
or obstruction of any
kind to mar their surfaces.
Nor is there danger
of disaster. Walled
in by massive parapets,
an accident is here impossible;
and in these
mighty galleries, hewn
from the mountain side
itself, the traveler is perfectly
secure, although
an avalanche may fall or
cyclones rage above him.

The Axenstrasse may be said to form a part of that magnificent
route from Switzerland to Italy, known as the St.
Gotthard. It is, in truth, the king of Alpine roads; resembling
a mighty chain which man, the victor, has imposed
upon the vanquished Alps,—one end sunk deep in the Italian
Lakes, the other guarded by the Lion of Lucerne,—and all
the intervening links kept burnished brightly by the hands of
trade. True, within the last few years, the carriage-road
across the St. Gotthard has been comparatively neglected,
since the longest
tunnel in the
world has to a
great extent replaced
it. Tranquil
enough this
tunnel frequently
appears, but I
have seen it when
great clouds of
smoke were pouring
out of its
huge throat, as
from the crater
of a great volcano.
A strong
wind blowing from the south was then, no doubt, clearing
this subterranean flue; and I was glad that I had not to
breathe its stifling atmosphere, but, on the contrary, seated
in a carriage, could lose no portion of the glorious scenery,
while drinking in great draughts of the pure mountain air.

Still, whether we travel by the railroad of the St. Gotthard
or not, we must not underrate its usefulness, nor belittle the
great engineering triumphs here displayed. Its length, too,
amazes one, for not only is the principal tunnel nine and a half

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_163' name='Page_163' href='#Page_163'></a></span>
miles long, but there are fifty-five others on the line, the
total length of which, cut inch by inch out of the solid granite,
is more than twenty-five miles. When one drives over the
mountain by the carriage-road, hour after hour, bewildered by
its cliffs and gorges, it seems impossible that the engineer's
calculations could have been made so perfectly as to enable
labor on the tunnel to be carried on from both ends of it at
the same time. Yet all was planned so well that, on the
28th of February, 1880, the Italian workmen and the Swiss
both met at the designated spot, six thousand feet below the
summit, and there pierced the last thin barrier that remained
between the north and south.

The number of railroad bridges on the St. Gotthard astonished
me. Their name is legion. Across them long trains
make their way among the clouds like monster centipedes,
creeping along the mountain-sides, or over lofty viaducts.
</p>

<p>
Here man's triumph over nature is complete. How puny
seems at first his strength when measured with the wind and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_166' name='Page_166' href='#Page_166'>166</a></span>
avalanche! But
mind has proved
superior to matter.
The ax was
made, and at its
sturdy stroke
the forest yielded
up its tribute
for the construction
of this pathway.
The caverns
of the earth
were also forced
to surrender the
iron treasured
there for ages,
and rails were made, along whose glittering lines a crowded
train now glides as smoothly as a boat upon the waves.
And yet these awful cliffs still scowl so savagely on either
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_167' name='Page_167' href='#Page_167'>167</a></span>
side, that the
steel rail, which
rests upon their
shelves of rock,
seems often like
a thread of fate,
by which a thousand
lives are
held suspended
over the abyss.

The volume
of freight transported
along this
route must be
enormous. But
why should tourists
(unless compelled by lack of time) consent to be carried
through this scenery like a bale of goods, in darkness rather
than in daylight? The best way still to cross the Alps is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_168' name='Page_168' href='#Page_168'>168</a></span>
to cross them, not to burrow through them. I should certainly
advise the traveler to drive from Lake Lucerne over the
St. Gotthard Pass, and then to take the train, if he desires to
do so, on the Italian side, as it emerges from the tunnel.
Thence, in a few brief hours one can embark upon Lake
Como, or see the sunset gild the statue-laden spires of Milan's
cathedral.

The finest scenery on the carriage-road of the St. Gotthard
is in a wild ravine, through which the river Reuss
rushes madly. Spanning the torrent in a single arch, is what
is popularly called "The Devil's Bridge." Perhaps I should
say bridges, for there are surely two of them, and though only
the smaller one is attributed to his Satanic Majesty, it is probably
by the newer, safer, and more orthodox one that Satan
nowadays, like a prudent devil, prefers to cross. The legend
of this celebrated bridge is extraordinary.

Some centuries ago, the mayor of the canton was one day
in despair because the mountain torrent had swept off every
bridge he had constructed
here. In his
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_169' name='Page_169' href='#Page_169'>169</a></span>
vexation he was rash enough to use
the name of the Devil, as some people
will. Hardly had he uttered the word,
when his door-bell rang, and his servant
brought him a card, on which he read
the words, "Monsieur Satan."

"Show him in," said the mayor.
A gentleman in black made his appearance,
and seated himself in an armchair.
The mayor placed his boots upon the
fender; the Devil rested his upon the
burning coals. The subject of the
bridge was broached, and the mayor
finally offered the Devil any sum that
the canton could raise, if he would build
them a bridge which would last one
hundred years. "Bah!" said Satan,
"What need have I of money?" And
taking
with his fingers
a red-hot
coal from
the fire, he offered it to his companion.
The mayor drew back
aghast. "Don't be afraid," said
Satan; and putting the coal in
the mayor's hand, it instantly
became a lump of gold. "Take
it back," said the mayor sadly;
"we are not talking now of
politics!" "You see," said the
Devil, with a smile, "my price
must be something else than
money. If I build this bridge,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_170' name='Page_170' href='#Page_170'>170</a></span>
I demand that the first living being that passes over it shall
be mine." "Agreed!" said the mayor. The contract was
soon signed. "<span lang="fr_FR">Au revoir!</span>" said the Devil. "<span lang="fr_FR">Au plaisir!</span>"

Early next morning the mayor himself hurried to the spot,
eager to see if Satan had fulfilled his contract. The bridge
was completed, and there sat Satan, swinging his legs over
the stream and waiting for his promised soul. "What,"
he exclaimed, as he espied the mayor, "do you unselfishly
resign <i>your</i> soul to me?" "Not much," replied the mayor,
proceeding to
untie a bag which
he had brought.
"What's that?"
cried Satan.
There was a wild
yell, and instantly
a big black
cat, with a tin
pan tied to its
tail, rushed over
the bridge as if
ten thousand dogs were after it. "There is your 'first living
being,'" cried the mayor. "Catch him!" Satan was
furious, but acknowledged that he had been outwitted and
retired,—contenting himself with making the air of the ravine
quite sulphurous with his remarks about home!

Alpine passes, the most historic of them is that of Mount St.
Bernard. Some years ago, on the last day of October, I left
the village of Martigny, which is the starting-point for the
ascent, and, several hours later, as night came creeping up the
Alps, found myself upon the famous pass, at a place already
higher than our own Mt. Washington, but still two thousand

feet below my destination,—the monastery. Through various
causes our party had been delayed, and now with the approach
of night a snow-storm swept our path with fearful violence.
Those who have never seen a genuine Alpine storm
can hardly comprehend its reckless fury. The light snow was
whirled and scattered,
like an ocean of spray,
over all things. A thousand
needles of ice
seemed to pierce our
skin. Drifts sprang up
in our path, as if by
magic. The winds
howled like unchained
demons through the jagged gorges, and a horrible feeling
of isolation made our hearts falter with a sickening sense
of helplessness. As mine was an October experience, I
shudder to think of what a genuine winter's storm must
be. For, as it was, we were all speedily numb with cold,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_174' name='Page_174' href='#Page_174'>174</a></span>
blinded by the whirling snow, and deafened by the roaring
wind, which sometimes drowned our loudest shouts to one
another.
</p>

<p>
Up and still up we rode, our poor mules plunging through
the snow, our fingers mechanically holding the reins, which
felt like icicles within our grasp, our guides rubbing their well-nigh
frozen hands, but, fortunately—most fortunately—never
becoming confused as to the way.
</p>

<p>
At length I saw, or thought I saw, through the blinding
snow, one of a group of buildings. I chanced to be the foremost
in our file of snow-bound travelers, and shouting, "Here
it is at last," I hastened toward the structure. No light was
visible. No voice responded to my call for help. I pounded
on the door and called again. No answer came; but at that
moment I felt my arm grasped roughly by my guide. "In
Heaven's name," he said, "do not jest on such a night as
this."
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_175' name='Page_175' href='#Page_175'>175</a></span>
</p>

<p>
"Jest!" I rejoined, with chattering teeth, "I have no wish
to jest—I am freezing. Where is the boasted hospitality
of your lazy monks? Shout! Wake them up!"
</p>

<p>
"They will
not wake," replied
the guide.
"Why not?"
I cried; and
beating the
door again, I
called at the
top of my voice:
"<span lang='fr_FR'>Au secours!
Réveillez-vous!</span>
Are you all dead
in here?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied
the guide.
</p>

<p class="caption">A CORRIDOR IN THE HOSPICE.</p>
</div>

<p>
It was now
my turn to stare
at him. "What do you mean?" I faltered. "What—what
does this house contain?" "Corpses," was the reply.
</p>

<p>
It was clear to me in a moment. I had mistaken the dead-house
for the house of shelter! In fancy I could see the
ghastly spectacle within, where bones of travelers whiten on
through centuries in an atmosphere whose purity defies decay.
</p>

<p>
But, almost simultaneously with his other words, I heard
my guide exclaim: "If you too would not join their number,
<i><span lang='fr_FR'>en avant, en avant, vite, vite</span></i>!" Then, seizing the bridle of
my mule, he urged me toward the monastery. A few moments
more and we arrived within its sheltering walls. One
of the brothers helped me to dismount, and led me up the
stone steps of the Hospice. And then, how blessed was our
reception! How warm the fire blazing on the ample hearth!
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_176' name='Page_176' href='#Page_176'>176</a></span>
How good the hot soup
and wine instantly brought
us by the kind friars! How
comforting the thought of
our surroundings, as the
baffled storm beat against
the frost-covered windows,
and seemed to shriek
with rage at being cheated
of its victims!

Next morning the storm had cleared away; yet even in
pleasant weather it is difficult to imagine anything more dreary
than the situation of this monastery, locked thus in snow and
ice, and sentineled by savage peaks, eight thousand feet
above the sea.
Even the pond
adjoining it is
gloomy from its
contrast to all
other lakes. Its
waters are too
cold for any
kind of fish, and
therefore fail to
attract hither
any kind of bird.

It was with admiration that I looked upon the self-sacrificing
heroes who reside here. What praise can be too high for
these devoted men, who say farewell to parents and to
friends, and leave the smiling vales of Switzerland and
Italy to live upon this glacial height? Few of them
can endure the hardship and exposure of the situation
longer than eight years, and then, with broken
health, they return (perhaps to die)
to the milder climate of the valleys.
During the long winter which binds
them here with icy chains for
nine months of the year, they
give themselves to the noble
work of rescuing, often amid
terrible exposure, those who
are then obliged to cross the
pass. In this they are aided
by their famous dogs, which,
like themselves, shrink from no
danger, and in their courage
and intelligence rival the masters
they so bravely serve. The travelers
whom they receive in winter
are not the rich, whose heavy purses
might recompense them for their
toil. They are mostly humble peasants, unable to give more
compensation than the outpouring of a grateful heart. But
there will come a day when these brave men will have their
full reward; when He, who with unerring wisdom weighs
all motives and all deeds, will say to them: "Inasmuch as
ye have done it unto one of the least of these my brethren,
ye have done it unto Me."

<p>
One of the most attractive of all the pleasure resorts in
Switzerland is the lovely Vale of Chamonix. The first view
one obtains of it, in coming over the mountains from Martigny,
is superb. Three monstrous glaciers, creeping out from their
icy lairs, lie beneath ice-fringed buttresses
of snow, like glittering serpents
watching for a favorable chance to
seize and swallow their prey. Looking
across the valley at them, it is true, they
seem quite harmless; but in reality, such
glaciers are the mighty wedges which have
for ages carved these mountains into shape, and are
still keeping them apart in solitary grandeur. What from a
distance seems a little bank of snow is probably a wall of ice,
one hundred feet in height. What look like wrinkles are
crevasses of an unknown depth; and the seeming puff of smoke
which one at times discerns upon them, is really a tremendous

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_179' name='Page_179' href='#Page_179'></a></span>
avalanche of snow and ice.
Of the three glaciers which
descend into the Vale of
Chamonix, the one most
frequently visited by tourists
is the Mer de Glace. It is
well called the "Sea of Ice,"
for its irregular surface looks
precisely like a mass of tossing
waves which have been
crystallized when in their
wildest agitation. To right
and left, the ice is partially
concealed by rocks and
earth, which have been
ground off from the adjacent
mountain-sides, or which have fallen there, as the result of
avalanches. Sometimes huge boulders are discernible, tossed
here and there like nut-shells,
the rocky <i>débris</i> of ages.

What is there more
suggestive of mysterious
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_182' name='Page_182' href='#Page_182'>182</a></span>
power than a frozen cataract like this? Apparently as cold
and motionless as death, it nevertheless is moving downward
with a slow, resistless march, whose progress can be accurately
traced from
day to day;
so accurately,
indeed, that
objects lost
to-day in one
of these crevasses
may be
confidently
looked for at
the glacier's
terminus after
a certain number
of years.
Forever nourished
on the
heights, forever
wasting in the valleys, these glaciers are the moving
mysteries of the upper world; vast, irresistible, congealed processions,—the
frozen reservoirs of rivers that glide at last
from their reluctant arms in a mad haste to reach the sea.

When we examine any portion of a glacier's surface,
we find abundant evidence of its motion. It has been forced

into a million
strange, distorted
shapes, many
of which are
larger than the

Between them
are vast chasms
of unknown
depth. As it
descends thus,
inch by inch,
obedient to the
pressure from above, it flings its frigid waves to the right and left, close to
the orchards and the homes of man. It is the ghastly synonym

To really
understand a
glacier one must
venture out
upon its icy
flood. One day
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_184' name='Page_184' href='#Page_184'>184</a></span>
while on the Mer de Glace, I was (as usual in such expeditions)
preceded and followed by a guide, to both of whom I was
attached by a stout rope. On that occasion one thing impressed
me greatly. It was a strange sound, called by the
guides "brullen," or growling, which is in reality the mysterious
moaning of the glacier, caused by the rending asunder
of huge blocks of ice in its slow, grinding descent.

<p class="caption">IRRESISTIBLE CONGEALED PROCESSIONS.</p>

<p>
At times it seemed to me impossible to proceed, but the
experienced guide who led the way laughed at my fears; and
finally, to increase my confidence, actually entered one of the
appalling caverns of the glacier, which like the jaws of some
huge polar bear, seemed capable of closing with dire consequences.
For a few minutes he remained
seated beneath a mass of
overhanging ice, apparently
as calm as I was
apprehensive for
his safety. No
accident occurred,
and
yet my fears
were not unfounded.
For
though there
is a fascination
in thus venturing
beneath
the frozen billows
of a glacier,
there may
be treachery in
its siren loveliness.

<p>
On entering
the little town
of Chamonix,
the tourist sees
in front of one
of the hotels a
group in bronze
that rivets his attention and awakens thought. It represents
the famous guide, Balmat, who first ascended Mont Blanc in
1786, enthusiastically pointing out the path of victory to the
Swiss scientist, De Saussure, who
had for years been offering a reward
to any one who should discover
a way to reach the summit.
The face of the brave conqueror
of Mont Blanc and that
of the distinguished scholar
are both turned toward
the monarch of the Alps.
Instinctively the traveler
also looks in that direction.
</p>

<p>
It is a memorable
moment when one gazes
for the first time upon
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_188' name='Page_188' href='#Page_188'>188</a></span>
Mont Blanc. We understand at once the reason for its
being called preëminently the "White Mountain." The
title was bestowed upon it because of the magnificent snow-white
mantle which it wears, at a height of almost sixteen
thousand feet. Probably no other mountain in the world
has so towered up on the horizon of our imaginations. Long
before we have actually seen it, we have repeated Byron's
words:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">
"Mount Blanc is the monarch of mountains;
</p>
<p class="i1">
  They crowned him long ago,
</p>
<p>
On a throne of rocks, in a robe of clouds,
</p>
<p class="i1">
  With a diadem of snow."
</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>
At once a strong desire seizes us to explore those boundless
fields of crystal clearness, and yet we shrink from all the
toil and danger thus involved. But, suddenly, as our gaze
returns to earth, we find a means of making the ascent without
fatigue—the telescope!
</p>

<p class="caption">A MOUNTAIN MAUSOLEUM.</p>
</div>

<p>
The placard suspended from it tells us that some tourists
are actually struggling toward the summit. The chances are
that they will return in safety; for the ascent of Mont Blanc,
which Balmat made with so much difficulty, has now been
reduced to a system. Yet after all, this Alpine climbing
is a dangerous business. It is pathetic, for example, to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_189' name='Page_189' href='#Page_189'>189</a></span>
recall the fate of poor Balmat himself. Despite his long
experience, even <i>he</i> lost his life at last by falling over a precipice.
Only his statue is in Chamonix; his body lies in an
immense abyss,
four hundred
feet in depth,
where falling
masses of rock
and ice are constantly
increasing
his vast
mausoleum, and
the continual
thunder of the
avalanche seems
like the mountain's
exultation
at its conqueror's
destruction.

<p class="caption">CLIMBERS IN SIGHT.</p>
</div>

<p>
Availing ourselves of the telescope, we watch with ease
and comfort the actual climbers on Mont Blanc. By this
time they have bound themselves together with a rope, which
in positions of peril is the first requisite of safety. For
one must always think of safety on these mountains. With
all their beauty and grandeur, they have sufficient capability
for cruelty to make the blood run cold. They have no mercy
in them; no sympathy for the warm hearts beating so near
their surfaces. They submit passively to conquest, so long as
man preserves a cool head and sure footing. But let him
make one false step; let his brain swim, his heart fail, his hand
falter, and they will hurl him from their icy slopes, or tear
him to pieces on their jagged tusks, while in the roar of the
avalanche is heard their demoniac laughter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_190' name='Page_190' href='#Page_190'>190</a></span>
</p>

<p>
But following the tourists still farther up the mountain,
we look with dismay at one of the icy crests along which
they must presently advance. Not a charming place for a
promenade, truly! Here it would seem that one should use
an alpen-stock rather as a balancing-pole than as a staff.
It is enough to make even a Blondin falter and retire. For,
coated with a glare of ice, and bordered on either side by an
abyss, the slightest misstep would inevitably send one shooting
down this glittering slope to certain death in one of the
vast folds of Mont Blanc's royal mantle.

<p>
Lifting now the telescope a little higher, we note another
difficulty which mountain-climbers frequently encounter.
For here they have come face to face with a perpendicular
wall of ice which they must climb, or else acknowledge a
defeat. The bravest, therefore, or the strongest, cuts with
his ax a sort of stairway in this crystal barrier, and, making
his way upward by this perilous route, lowers a rope and is
rejoined by his companions. Imagine doing this in the teeth
of such wind and cold as must often be met with on these crests!

straight into
the face in
freezing spray
like a shower of
needles; when
the gloves are

I know it is customary now to laugh at any dangers on
Mont Blanc; and yet a terrible disaster took place there no
longer ago than 1870.
</p>

<p>
In the month of September of that year, a party of eleven
(including two Americans) started to climb the mountain.
Near the summit a frightful tempest burst upon them. The
guides no longer recognized the way, and, unable to return or
find shelter, the entire party perished. The bodies of five
were recovered. In the pocket of one of them (an American
from Baltimore) were found these words, written to his wife:
"7th of September, evening. We have been for two days
on Mont Blanc in a terrific hurricane. We have lost our way,
and are now at an altitude of fifteen thousand feet. I have
no longer any hope. We have nothing to eat. My feet are
already frozen, and I have strength enough only to write
these words. Perhaps they will be found and given to you.

But such a
mountain as
Mont Blanc can
rarely be ascended
in a single
day. Two days
are generally
given to the task.
On the evening
of the first day
its would-be conquerors
reach,
at a height of
ten thousand feet, a desolate region called the Grands Mulets.
Here on some savage-looking rocks are two small cabins.
One is intended for a kitchen, the other for a sleeping-room;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_195' name='Page_195' href='#Page_195'>195</a></span>
that is, if one
can sleep in such
a place; for what
an excitement
there must be in
passing a night
at this great altitude!
The distant
stars gleam
in the frosty air
with an unwonted
brilliancy and
splendor. The
wind surges against the cliffs with the full, deep boom of the
sea; while the silence in the unmeasurable space above is awe-inspiring.

But, on the morrow, the glorious view repays one for a
night of sleeplessness. At first one looks apparently upon a
shoreless ocean,
whose rolling
billows seem
now white, now
opalescent, in
the light of
dawn. Then,
one by one, the
various mountain
peaks appear
like islands
rising from the
sea. At last,
these waves of
vapor sink slowly
downward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_196' name='Page_196' href='#Page_196'>196</a></span>
through the valleys, and disappear in full retreat before the
god of day. But till they vanish, the traveler could suppose
that he had here survived the deluge of the world, and was
watching its huge shrouded corpse at his feet.

Between the Grands Mulets and the summit, Mont Blanc
makes three tremendous steps, from eight hundred to one
thousand feet in height, and between these are several frightful
chasms, so perilous that on beholding them we catch our
breath. There is something peculiarly horrible in these crevasses,
yawning gloomily, day and night, as if with a never-satisfied
hunger. A thousand—nay ten thousand—men in
their cavernous jaws would not constitute a mouthful. They
are even more to be dreaded than the avalanche; for the path
of the avalanche is usually known; but these crevasses frequently
hide their black abysses under deceitful coverlets of
snow, luring unwary travelers to destruction. Nevertheless
the avalanche is in certain places an ever-present danger.
Mountains of snow stand toppling on the edge of some stupendous
cliff, apparently waiting merely for the provocation
of a human voice, intruding on their solitude, to start upon
their awful plunge. The world well knows the fate of those
who have been caught in
such a torrent of destruction.

one's life. The concentrated refulgence on that solitary dome

</div>

<p>
One singular experience of Alpine travel is indelibly impressed
upon my memory. It occurred on my passage of the
Gemmi into the
valley of the
Rhone. The
Gemmi Pass is
no magnificent
highway like
the St. Gotthard,
macadamized
and smooth
and carefully
walled in by
parapets of
stone. It is for
miles a rough
and dangerous
bridle-path, the
edge of which
is sometimes decorated with a flimsy rail, but often has not
even that apology for safety. One can thus readily believe
that, like the Jordan, the Gemmi is emphatically "a hard
road to travel." At all events I found it so, especially as I
crossed it early in the season, before the winter's ravages had
been repaired.
Since I was at
the time suffering
from a temporary
lameness,
I could walk but
little. With
this road dates
my first acquaintance with a mule,—an intimacy that will
never be forgotten! All day long that memorable beast
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_202' name='Page_202' href='#Page_202'>202</a></span>
would never for one instant change his gait, nor was the
monotony of his dreadful walk once broken by a trot. My
only consolation was in the thought that if the beast did change
it, my neck, as well as the monotony, would probably be
broken. Thus, hour after hour, I kept moving on and up,
my knees forced wide apart by this great, lumbering wedge,
until I felt like a colossal wish-bone, and as though I should
be bow-legged for the rest of my life.
</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">A FRAIL PARAPET.</p>
</div>

<p>
Nor was this all; for, as the day wore on, the mule took
special pains to make my
blood run cold by a variety
of acrobatic feats, which
might have made a chamois
faint with vertigo.
For example, wherever a
rail was lacking in the crazy
fence, he would deliberately
fill the space with his own
body and mine, walking so
dangerously near the brink,
that half my form would be
suspended over the abyss!
Of course, the moment it
was passed, I laughed or
scolded, as most travelers
do; yet, after all, in such cases we never know how great the
peril may have been. A little stone, a clod of earth, a movement
in the nick of time—these are sometimes the only
things which lie between one and the great Unknown, and
hinder one from prematurely solving the mysterious problem
of existence.

</div>

<p>
Nevertheless, on the fearful precipices for which the
Gemmi is noted, one may be pardoned for being a trifle nervous.
At certain points the bridle-path so skirts the chasm
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_203' name='Page_203' href='#Page_203'>203</a></span>
that one false
step would land
the fragments of
your body on the
rocks a thousand
feet below; while,
on the other side,
the mountain
towers up abrupt
and bare, with
scarce a shrub or
tree to cling to
or console the
dizzy traveler.
My flesh creeps
now to think of
some of these places; and in the same space of time I think I
never repented of so many sins, as during that passage of the
Gemmi. At
length, however,
the climax
seemed reached;
for at the brink
of one abyss the
path appeared
to end. I cautiously
advanced
to the edge and
looked over. It
was a fearful
sight, for here
the mountain
falls away to a
sheer depth of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_204' name='Page_204' href='#Page_204'>204</a></span>
sixteen hundred feet, and the plumb-line might drop to that
full length without encountering any obstacle.

<p>
When Alexander Dumas came to this place, and (unprepared
for what he was to see) looked down from the brink of
the stupendous precipice, he fell back unconscious; and afterward,
while making the descent, his teeth so chattered with
nervousness, that he placed his folded handkerchief between
them. Yet
when, on reaching
the valley,
he removed it,
he found it had
been cut through
and through as
with a razor. I
cannot, certainly,
lay claim to
nervousness like
that; but I could
sympathize with
one of our fellow-countrymen,
against
whose name on
the hotel register I next day saw these words: "Thank God,
we don't raise such hills as these in the State of New York!"
</p>

<p>
At the other side of the Gemmi, and almost at the base of
these gigantic cliffs, there lies a little village. When I stood
on the precipice above it, I thought that a pebble hurled
thence from my hand would fall directly on its roofs; but in
reality their distance from the cliffs was greater than it seemed.
This village is the celebrated Leuk, whose baths have now
acquired a world-wide reputation. Leuk has, however, this
misfortune: so many strangers come here now to bathe, that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_205' name='Page_205' href='#Page_205'>205</a></span>
many of the inhabitants
themselves
think that
they can dispense
with the
luxury.

<p>
I never shall
forget the baths
of Leuk. Shades
of the Mermaids!
what a sight they
presented. In a
somewhat shabby
hall, containing
great compartments
of hot
water, I saw a multitude of heads—long-haired and short-haired,
light and dark, male and female—bobbing about like
buoys adorned with
sea-weed. A fine
chance this to study
physiognomy, pure
and simple. In front
of these amphibious
creatures were floating
tables, upon
which they could
eat, drink, knit,
read, and even play
cards to pass away
the time. As these
waters are chiefly
used for skin diseases,
one might
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_206' name='Page_206' href='#Page_206'>206</a></span>
suppose that each bather would prefer a separate room; but
no, in this case "misery loves company." The length of
time which one must remain soaking in these tanks of hot
water makes solitary bathing unendurable.
</p>

<p>
I asked one of these heads how long it had to float here
daily. The mouth opened just above the water's edge and
answered: "Eight hours, Monsieur; four before luncheon,
and four before dinner; and, as after each bath we have
to spend an hour in bed, ten hours a day are thus consumed."
</p>

<p>
It may seem incredible, but I assure the reader that some
of these parboiled bathers actually sleep while in these tanks.
I, myself, saw a head drooped backward as though severed
from the body. Its eyes were closed; its mouth was slightly
open; and from the nose a mournful sound came forth at
intervals, which told me that the man was snoring. Before
him, half-supported by the little table, half-bedraggled
in the flood, was a newspaper.
Bending over the rail, I read the title.
Poor man! I no longer wondered
that he slept. Those who have
read the ponderous sheet will understand
its soporific effect.
It was a copy of the London
<i>Times</i>.

After the baths of
Leuk and the stupendous
precipices of the Gemmi,
it is a pleasure to approach
a less imposing but more
beautiful part of Switzerland,—Geneva
and its
lake. The bright, cream-colored
buildings of the
one present a beautiful

contrast to the
other's deep blue
waves. Next to
Stockholm and
Naples, Geneva
has, I think, the
loveliest situation
of any city
in Europe.
Curved, crescent-like,
around
the southwest
corner of the lake, the river Rhone with arrowy swiftness
cleaves it into two parts, thus furnishing the site for all the
handsome quays and bridges which unite the various sections
of the town.

What a surprising change has taken place in the appearance

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_210' name='Page_210' href='#Page_210'>210</a></span>
Lake Geneva at its other extremity, forty-five miles away!
There it is muddy, dark, and travel-stained from its long journey
down the valley. But here it has become once more as
pure as when it left its cradle in the glaciers. Its sojourn in
the lake has given it both beauty and increased vitality; and
as it starts again upon its course and darts out from Geneva
with renewed strength and speed, its waters are superbly blue
and clear as crystal.

<p>
As it emerges from the lake, a sharp-pointed island confronts
the rapid
stream, as if
awaiting its advance.
Its station
here before
the city resembles
that of some
fair maid of
honor who precedes
a queen.
It is called Rousseau's
Island, in
honor of the
famous man
whose birth the
city claims. Geneva certainly should be grateful to him, for
it was he who first made this fair lake renowned in literature,
and called to it the attention of the world. In fact, he did
almost as much to render famous this enchanting spot, as
Scott did for the region of the Trosachs. Appropriately,
therefore, a fine bronze statue of Rousseau has been erected
on the island, the figure looking up the lake, like the presiding
genius of the place.

One can with both pleasure and profit spend a fortnight in
Geneva. Its well-kept and luxurious hotels all front upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_211' name='Page_211' href='#Page_211'>211</a></span>
quays, and from your windows there (as from the Grand Hotel
in Stockholm) you look upon an ever-varying panorama—a
charming combination of metropolitan and aquatic life.
Boats come and go at frequent intervals, accompanied by the
sound of music. The
long perspectives of the
different bridges, full of
animated life, afford
perpetual entertainment; while, in
dull weather, the attractive shops,
in some respects unrivaled in the
whole of Europe, tempt you, beyond
your power to resist, to purchase music-boxes
or enameled jewelry. After all, one's greatest pleasure
here is to embark upon the lake itself. This famous body of
water forms a beautiful blue crescent, forty-five miles in
length and eight in breadth. Tyndall declared that it had
the purest natural water ever analyzed; Voltaire called it the
"First of Lakes;" Alexander Dumas compared it to the
Bay of Naples; while Victor Hugo, Lamartine, and Byron
have given it boundless praise in their glowing verse. It
has been estimated that should the lake henceforth receive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_212' name='Page_212' href='#Page_212'>212</a></span>
no further increase, while having still the river
Rhone for its outlet, it would require ten years to
exhaust its volume. It might be likened, therefore,
to a little inland
sea. In fact, a pretty
legend says that the
ocean-deity, Neptune,
came one day to see
Lake Leman, and, enraptured
with its fresh
young beauty, gave to
it, on departing, his
likeness in miniature.
Moreover, it has another charm—that
of historical association.
Its shores have been the residence of men of genius. Both
history and poetry have adorned its banks with fadeless wreaths
of love and fame. Each hill that rises softly from its waves is
crowned with some distinguished memory. Byron has often
floated on its surface; and here he wrote some portions of
"Childe Harold," which will be treasured to the end of time.

The poet Shelley narrowly escaped drowning in its waters.
At one point Madame de Staël lived in exile; another saw
Voltaire for years maintaining here his intellectual court;
while at Lausanne, upon the memorable night which he
has well described, Gibbon concluded
his immortal work, "The
Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire." But of all portions of Lake Leman,
that which charms one most is the neighborhood of Montreux
and Vevey, and the historic Castle of Chillon. A poet's
inspiration has made this place familiar to the world. No
English-speaking traveler, at least, can look upon these towers,

This time-worn structure boasts
a thousand years of story and romance.
In fact, more than a thousand
years ago, Louis le Débonnaire
imprisoned here a traitor to his king.
Here, also, five centuries ago, hundreds of Jews were tortured,
and then buried alive, on the infamous suspicion of poisoning
the wells of Europe. But
of all the
memories which cluster
round its walls the most
familiar is that of Bonnivard,
the Swiss patriot, who
languished for six years in its
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_217' name='Page_217' href='#Page_217'>217</a></span>
dark dungeon, till he was released by the efforts of his enthusiastic
countrymen. During those gloomy years of captivity
his jailers heard
from him no cry
and no complaint,
save when
some tempest
swept the lake.
Then, when the
wind moaned, as
if in sympathy,
around the towers,
and waves
dashed high
against the
walls, they could
distinguish sobs
and cries, proving
that, when apparently alone with God, the captive sought
to give his burdened soul relief.

When finally his liberators burst into his cell, they found
him pale and shadow-like, still chained to the column around
which he had walked so many years. A hundred voices cried
to him at once: "Bonnivard, you are free!" The prisoner
slowly rose, and his first question was: "And Geneva?"
"Free, also!" was the answer.

One night, some eighty years ago, a little boat came
toward this castle, leaving behind it in its course a furrow

silvered by the moon. As it reached the shore, there sprang
from it a man enveloped in a long black cloak, which almost
hid his feet from
view. A close
observer would
have seen, however,
that he
limped slightly.
He asked to see
the historic dungeon,
and lingered
there an
hour alone.
When he had gone, they found on the stone column to which
Bonnivard had been chained a new name carved. The traveler
sees it there to-day.
It is the
name of Byron.

<p class="caption">ZERMATT.</p>
</div>

<p>
There is in
Switzerland a
village superior
even to Chamonix
in grandeur
of location, dominated
by a
mountain more
imposing even
than Mont
Blanc. The
town is Zermatt;
the mountain is
the Matterhorn.
As we approach it, we discern only a tiny part of its environment;
but could we soar aloft with the eagle, and take a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_221' name='Page_221' href='#Page_221'>221</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_220' name='Page_220' href='#Page_220'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_219' name='Page_219' href='#Page_219'></a></span>
bird's-eye view of it, the little village would appear to have
been caught in a colossal trap of rock and ice. There is, in
fact, no path to
it, save over dangerous
passes,
or through a
narrow cleft in
the encircling
mountains, down
which a river
rushes with impetuous
fury;
while, watching
over it, like some divinely-stationed sentinel, rises the awful
Matterhorn, the most unique and imposing mountain of the
Alps. No view
can possibly
do it justice;
yet, anticipate
what you will,
it is here impossible
to be
disappointed.
Though every
other object
of the world
should fail, the
Matterhorn
must stir the
heart of the
most unimpressive
traveler.
Not only does its icy wedge pierce the blue air at a
height of fifteen thousand feet above the sea, but its gaunt,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_222' name='Page_222' href='#Page_222'>222</a></span>
tusk-like form emerges from the surrounding glaciers with
almost perpendicular sides, four thousand feet in height. It is
a manifestation of the power of
the Deity, beside which all the
works of man dwindle
to insignificance. I
never grew accustomed
to this, as
to other mountains.
No matter when I
gazed upon its sharp-cut
edges and its ice-bound
rocks,
I felt, as
when I first beheld
it, completely
overpowered by its magnitude. The history of this colossal
pyramid is as tragic as its grim form is awe-inspiring. The
mountain is known as the "Fiend of the Alps." Year after
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_223' name='Page_223' href='#Page_223'>223</a></span>
year it had been
luring to itself,
with fearful fascination,
scores
of brave men
who longed to
scale its appalling
cliffs. Over
its icy pedestal,—up
its precipitous
sides,—yes,
even to its
naked shoulders,
baffled
and wistful
mountaineers
struggled in vain. Upon its perpendicular rocks several men
had all but perished; but the warnings were unheeded. At
length, after persistent
efforts
for eleven years,
the famous English
mountain-climber,
Whymper,
gained the
summit. But in
return for the
humiliation of
this conquest the
Matterhorn exacted
speedy
vengeance.

consisting of four Englishmen and three guides, elated by
their victory, were just beginning their descent, one of them
slipped, knocking a guide completely off his feet and dragging
his companions after him, since all were bound together by a
rope. Four of them hung an instant there, head downward,
between earth and heaven. The other three clung desperately
to the icy crags, and
would have
rescued them, had not the rope
between them broken. There was
a fearful cry—a rush of falling
bodies. Then Whymper and two guides
found themselves clinging to the rocks, and
looking into each other's haggard faces, pale as
death. The others had fallen over the precipice—nearly
four thousand feet—to the ice below!

On my last evening at Zermatt, I lingered in the deepening
twilight to say farewell to this unrivaled peak. At first
its clear-cut silhouette stood forth against the sky, unutterably
grand, while darkness shrouded its giant form. So
overwhelming appeared its tapering height, that I no longer
wondered at the belief of the peasants that the gate of Paradise
was situated on its summit; because it seemed but a
step thence to Heaven.

<p>
At last there came a change, for which I had been waiting
with impatience. In the blue vault of heaven the full-orbed
moon came forth to sheathe the Matterhorn in silver. In that
refulgent light its icy edges looked
like crystal ropes; and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_228' name='Page_228' href='#Page_228'>228</a></span>
its sharp, glistening rocks resembled silver steps leading to the
stupendous pinnacle above. Never, this side the shore of
Eternity, do I expect to see a vision so sublime as that of
moonlight on the Matterhorn. For from the gleaming parapets
of this Alpine pyramid, not "forty centuries," but forty
thousand ages look down on us as frivolous pygmies of a day.
Yes, as I gazed on this illumined obelisk, rising from out its
glittering sea of ice, to where—four thousand feet above—the
moving stars flashed round its summit like resplendent
gems, it seemed a fitting emblem of creative majesty—the
scepter of Almighty God.

Athens
</h2>

<p>
A nation's influence is not dependent on its size.
Its glory is not measured by square miles. Greece is
the smallest of all European countries, being not
larger than the State of Massachusetts. Yet, in the light of
what a few Athenians accomplished in the days of Phidias,
China's four hundred millions seem
like shadows cast by moving clouds.
China compared to Athens! The
enlightened world could better lose
the entire continent of Asia from its
history than that little area. Better
fifty years of Athens than a cycle of
Cathay. In the historic catalogue
of earth's great cities Athens stands
alone. The debt which civilization
owes her is incalculable. For centuries
Athens was the school of
Rome, and through Rome's conquests
she became the teacher of the
world. If most of her art treasures
had not been torn from her, first
to embellish Rome, and subsequently to enrich the various
museums of the world, Athens would now be visited
by thousands instead of hundreds. But even in her desolation
Athens repays a pilgrimage. Were absolutely nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_232' name='Page_232' href='#Page_232'>232</a></span>
of her glory left, it would still remain a privilege merely to
stand amid the scenes where human intellect reached a height
which our material progress has not equaled. They err who
say that Greece is dead. She cannot die. The Language of
Demosthenes is still extant. Not only are its accents heard
within the shadow of the Parthenon; it is so interwoven with
our own, that we unconsciously make use of its old words, as
one walks on a pavement of mosaic, unmindful whence its
pieces came. The Greek Religion lives in every statue of
the gods, in every classical allusion, in every myth which poets
weave into the garland of their song. What could a sculptor
do without the gods and heroes of old Greek mythology?
Hellenic Architecture lives in every reproduction of Doric
column or Corinthian capital. The Art of the Acropolis
remains the
standard for all
time. The History
of Greece
still gives to us as
models of heroic patriotism,
Thermopylæ and Marathon. Even
her ideas live,—the thoughts of Phidias in marble; of Plato in
philosophy; of Socrates in morals; of Euripides and Sophocles
in tragedy.

What, then, if it be true that Greece has greatly changed
in twenty centuries? The influence of ancient Greece comes

<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_233' name='Page_233' href='#Page_233'></a></span>
down the ages to us like the light from a fixed star. The
star itself may have gone out in darkness years ago; but
waves of brilliancy which left it previous to its destruction
are traveling toward us still, and fall in silvery pulsations on
our earth to-day. The best way to approach the shores of
Greece is over
the classic Mediterranean
and
Ægean seas.
Around these
oceans gather
more thrilling
and inspiring associations
than
cluster about any others on the globe. Upon no equal area
of the earth's surface have so many mighty events happened or
deeds been enacted as around these inland seas. Every keel
that now cleaves their waters traverses the scene of some
maritime struggle or adventure of ancient times, or glides by
shores forever hallowed to the scholar and historian by the
memories of the genius and grandeur that have passed away.
To sail on Grecian waters is to float through history. The
seas of other countries gleam with phosphorescence; hers
sparkle with the scintillations of a deathless fame. The very
islands they caress have been the cradles of fable, poesy and
history. From each has sprung a temple, a statue, a poem,
or at least a myth, which still exists to furnish joy and inspiration
to the world.
</p>

<p class="caption">THROUGH GRECIAN WATERS.</p>
</div>

<p>
It is with the liveliest anticipations of pleasure that one
who is inspired by these memories, arrives at the port of
Athens, which still retains its ancient title,—The Piræus. Its
appearance is not especially attractive, and yet I gazed upon
it with profound emotion. Still are its waves as blue as when
Athenian vessels rode at anchor here, or swept hence to the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_236' name='Page_236' href='#Page_236'>236</a></span>
island of Salamis to aid in the destruction of the Persian fleet
and cause the mad flight of the terror-stricken Xerxes.
Around them History and Poetry have woven an immortal
charm, for in their limpid depths have been reflected the forms
of almost every famous Greek and Roman of antiquity.
</p>

<p>
But the Piræus, after all, is merely a doorway to glories
beyond. Hence one quickly leaves the steamer here, and
hastens to the capital itself, six miles away. A train of street-cars,
drawn by a steam-engine, was one of the first objects
that confronted us in the streets of Athens, but even this
reminder of the nineteenth century could not dispel the fascination
of antiquity. It all swept back upon me. The locomotive
and the tram-cars faded from my view, and in their
place I saw again my school-room, with its rows of well-worn
desks. Once more was felt the summer breeze, as it stole
through the open window, and lured me from my lexicon to
the fair fields. Xenophon's graphic prose and Homer's matchless
verse at last seemed real to me; for over the shop-doors
were the Greek characters that I had learned in boyhood, and
on the corners of
the streets were
words once uttered
by the lips of
Socrates.

<p class="caption">THE DISTANT CITADEL.</p>
</div>

<p>
Even before
the tourist reaches
the outskirts
of the city of
Minerva, he
plainly sees rising in bold relief against the sky, what was
in ancient times the gem of Athens, the casket of the
rarest architectural jewels in the world,—the temple-crowned
Acropolis. It is a memorable moment when one first
beholds it. No other citadel in the world has embraced
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_237' name='Page_237' href='#Page_237'>237</a></span>
so much beauty and splendor within its walls. Not one has
witnessed such startling changes in the fortunes of its possessors.
Its history reaches back over a period of two thousand
four hundred years. Wave after wave of war and conquest
have beaten against it. It has been plundered by the
Persian, the Spartan, the Macedonian,
the Roman, the
Venetian and the Turk.
Yet there is now a
modern city at its base,
astonishingly new
and fresh, compared
with its historic
background. The
buildings of to-day
and those of two
thousand years ago
seem gazing at each other with surprise. Yet there is no hostility
between them. Despite her tattered robes of royalty,
Old Athens sits enthroned as the acknowledged sovereign.
New Athens kneels in reverence before her. For the modern
Greeks still cling with pride to the memories of Pericles and
Phidias, and sigh when they think of the glory that once
was theirs.

<p class="caption">A WALK AROUND THE ACROPOLIS.</p>
</div>

<p>
A walk around the Acropolis reveals the fact that it is a
natural mass of rock, built up in places by substantial
masonry. On three sides it is practically perpendicular.
Two thousand years ago its summit rose toward heaven, like
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_238' name='Page_238' href='#Page_238'>238</a></span>
a magnificent altar consecrated to the gods. There, elevated
in the sight of all, and overlooking the adoring city on the
one side and the blue Ægean on the other, stood those
incomparable specimens of architectural beauty, grace and
majesty, which
have made
Athens immortal.
Even now,
although its
temples are
in ruins, the
few remaining
columns of
the Parthenon
stand out in
delicate relief
against the sky,
like strings of
an abandoned
harp, which
even the most
skilful hand
can never wake
again to melody.

</div>

<p>
In making the ascent of this historic eminence by the
only avenue of approach, the traveler soon finds himself before
the ruined entrance to the Acropolis,—the Propylæa. This
was originally a majestic gateway of Pentelic marble, crowning
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_239' name='Page_239' href='#Page_239'>239</a></span>
a marble staircase seventy feet in breadth, which led up
from the city to the brow of the Acropolis. Its cost was
two and a half millions of dollars. It was considered, in its
prime, equal, if not superior, to the Parthenon. Nor is this
strange, for this portal was a veritable gallery of art. Along
its steps were arranged those chiseled forms that almost
lived and breathed in their transcendent beauty,—the masterpieces
of Praxiteles and Phidias, the mutilated fragments of
which we now cherish as our most perfect models of the
beautiful.
</p>

<p class="caption">THE SUMMIT OF THE ACROPOLIS.</p>
</div>

<p>
Yet there was nothing effeminate in this magnificence.
Solidity and splendor here went hand in hand. When the
Propylæa was finished, under Pericles, more than four centuries
were still to pass before the birth of Christ; yet so much strength
was here combined with beauty, that, if no human hands had
striven to deface it, its splendid shafts would, no doubt,
still be perfect. The columns that remain appear to stand
like sentinels, guarding their
illustrious past. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_240' name='Page_240' href='#Page_240'>240</a></span>
thrills one to reflect that these identical pillars have cast
their shadows on the forms of Phidias, Pericles, Demosthenes,
and indeed every Greek whose name has been preserved
in history.

When I passed on beyond the Propylæa, and gained a
broader view of the Acropolis, I looked around me with
astonishment. The whole
plateau is literally covered
with headless
statues, fallen columns
and disjointed
capitals.
Some of them
bear unfinished
sentences, as
though these
blocks would
speak, if they were
properly restored.
Their power of
speech, however,
has been forever paralyzed by the destructive
blows they have received. This rugged rock is
nevertheless an illustrated volume of Greek history bound in
stone. Its letters are disfigured, its binding is defaced, but
the old volume is still legible; and it assures us that this tiny
platform, scarcely one thousand feet in length and four
hundred in breadth, is richer in some respects than any other
portion of the globe, for in the golden crucible of memory,

It is, however, to the highest point of the plateau that
the tourist's gaze turns with keenest interest, for there stood
what was formerly the crown of the Acropolis, the architectural
glory of the world,—The Parthenon.

No photographic view can do it justice. Pictures invariably
represent its marble columns as dark and dingy, like the
sooty architecture
of London.
But such is not
the case. The
discolorations
are so slight as
hardly to be
blemishes. The
general appearance
of the edifice
is one of
snowy whiteness,
softly defined
against the clear,
blue sky, and I have seen its columns in the glow of sunset
gleam like shafts of gold. But on approaching it more closely,
one sees that nothing can conceal the ravages of time and man.
Yet, only two hundred years ago it stood comparatively
unchanged in its unrivaled beauty. The Turks were then the
masters of this classic land. They showed their appreciation
of the Parthenon by using it as a powder-magazine! In
1687 an army of Venetians recklessly bombarded Athens,
and one of their shells exploded in this shrine. Instantly,
with a wild roar, as though Nature herself shrieked at the
sacrilege, the Parthenon was ruined. Columns on either side
were blown to atoms, the front was severed from the rear,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_244' name='Page_244' href='#Page_244'>244</a></span>
and the entire hill was strewn with marble fragments, mute
witnesses of countless forms of beauty lost to us forever.
</p>

<p class="caption">FRONT VIEW OF THE PARTHENON.</p>
</div>

<p>
One of these fragments is a portion of the frieze that once
surrounded the entire edifice like a long garland of rare beauty.
How careful were the old Greek artists of their reputation;
how conscientious in their art! The figures in this frieze
were fifty feet above the ground, where small defects would
never have been noticed, yet every part of each was finished
with the utmost care. While they remained there for two
thousand years, this trait of old Greek character was unperceived;
but, with their downfall and removal, the sculptor's
grand fidelity to truth was brought to light,—as death sometimes
reveals the noble qualities which we in life, alas! have
not observed.
</p>

<p>
Enough of the Parthenon remains to show the literal perfection
of its masonry. It has, for example, in its steps,
walls, and columns, curves so minute as to be hardly visible,
yet true to the one-hundredth part of an inch. They
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_245' name='Page_245' href='#Page_245'>245</a></span>
show alike the splendid genius of the architect and the wonderful
skill of the workmen. For all the curves are mathematical.
The reasons for them can be demonstrated like a
problem in geometry. Once fifty life-size statues stood upon
its pediments. Around it ran a sculptured frieze, five hundred
and twenty feet in length, carved mainly by the hand of
Phidias; while the especial treasure of the temple was the
famous statue of Athene Parthenos, made of ivory and gold.
The value of the precious metal used in this one figure was
seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

<p>
It is a marvel that any fragments can be gathered on the top
of the Acropolis,
after the
persistent spoliation
which
Greece has undergone
for more
than eighteen
centuries. From
the one city of
Delphi alone Nero is said to have carried off to Rome
five hundred bronze statues. How many beautiful works
in marble, gold and ivory he removed, we cannot tell.
And when the Roman conqueror, Æmilius Paulus, was borne
in triumph up the Appian Way, exhibiting the spoils of conquered
Greece, there preceded him two hundred and fifty
wagons filled with the rarest pictures and statues of Greek
artists, after which came three thousand men, each bearing
some gold or silver ornament taken from Hellenic cities. Yet
this was merely the beginning of the plundering, which practically
ended only fifty years ago, when Lord Elgin carried
off to London over two hundred and fifty feet of the beautifully
sculptured frieze of the Parthenon. Opinions differ
in regard to the propriety of this act on the part of Lord
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_246' name='Page_246' href='#Page_246'>246</a></span>
Elgin. Defenders of his conduct urge that, had this not
been done, these works of art would have been ruined
by the Turks. Others maintain that they would have
remained intact, and point to some of the comparatively uninjured
decorations of the shrines of the Acropolis, such as the
Caryatides of the Erectheum, which have at least never been
injured by the Turks, though one of them was removed to
England by Lord Elgin. At all events, it would be a noble
and graceful act on the part of England particularly, and of
many other countries also, to restore some of her lost art-treasures
to Greece,—now that she has risen again to the rank of a
well-governed and progressive nation. It is sad indeed to
see in Athens only plaster casts of the incomparable works of
her old sculptors, the originals of which enrich so many
European capitals.

<p>
One of the most beautiful of the ruined shrines of the
Acropolis is the "Temple of Wingless Victory;" so-called
because the statue of the goddess was represented without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_247' name='Page_247' href='#Page_247'>247</a></span>
wings, in the fond hope that Victory would never fly away from
the Athenian capital. Most of the beautiful statues which
adorned this building were carried off to the British Museum
seventy years ago, and some were ruined in the process of
removal. One exquisite portion of the frieze, which had for
twenty centuries stood forth resplendent over the historic city,
was carelessly dropped and broken into atoms. A Greek who
was standing near, watching this shameful devastation, brushed
away a tear, and with a sob exclaimed pathetically: "Telos!"
(That is the end of it!) and turned away.
</p>

<p>
No one has condemned the plunder of the Acropolis more
trenchantly than Byron, in the lines:
</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

"Cold is the heart, fair Greece! that looks on thee,

</p>
<p>

Before the mental vision of the traveler, who muses thus
upon the crest of the Acropolis, there naturally rises the form
of the goddess Athene
(or, as the Romans called
her, Minerva), who gave
the name Athens to the
city which she specially
protected. Who can forget
how this old classic
citadel, within whose
shrines this goddess was
adored, remained for
many centuries, even in
its ruin, a beacon light of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_248' name='Page_248' href='#Page_248'>248</a></span>
history? Its radiance pierced even the darkness of the Middle
Ages, when, over-run by conquerors, pillaged by barbarians,
assailed by fanatics, the world of art lay buried
beneath the rubbish of brutality and ignorance. Under the
blows of the iconoclasts, the pulse of artistic life had almost
ceased to beat. But,
though the fire of
genius seemed extinct,
there was still
vitality in its dying
embers. The light
which came from the
Acropolis gave its
illumination to the
Renaissance. Without
an Athens there
had been no Florence;
without a
Phidias no Michael
Angelo.

<p>
Almost as interesting
as a visit to
the summit of the
Acropolis is a walk
around its base. A part
of it is lined with ruins,
many of them being demolished theatres. Upon the hill
the drama of the gods went on: below it were performed
the tragedy and comedy of man. One of these theatres,
called the Odeon, was of Roman origin, built by the conquerors
of Greece when they were masters of the world.
Its rows of massive arches, climbing one above another up
the cliff, remind us of the Colosseum. Above them was the
classic Parthenon, which Phidias had built five hundred years
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_251' name='Page_251' href='#Page_251'>251</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_250' name='Page_250' href='#Page_250'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_249' name='Page_249' href='#Page_249'></a></span>
before. This theatre could accommodate
eight thousand people, and
doubtless was magnificent and imposing;
but amid such surroundings
it must have seemed to the Athenians
like an interloper and intruder,—a
gilded fetter on a lovely slave.

<p>
Vastly more interesting, however,
than the Odeon is the edifice which
adjoins it,—the ancient theatre of
Bacchus,—built by the Greeks two
thousand four hundred years ago. It
was excavated from the side of the
Acropolis, just below the Parthenon.
Its rows of seats were partly sculptured
from the solid rock and partly
built up of Pentelic
marble,
and thirty
thousand people could be seated
here. Its form was a perfect amphitheatre,
a model for all others
in the world. How grand was its
simplicity! Its light was furnished
by the sun. God was the
painter of its drop-curtain, which
was the sunset sky; the scenery
was that of mountains and the
sea; its only roof was the blue
dome of heaven.

<p>
A portion of the front of the
old stage is still intact. If the
old Greeks had needed footlights,
they would have placed them
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_252' name='Page_252' href='#Page_252'>252</a></span>
on this marble parapet. It sends the
blood in a swift current to the heart to
think that all its kneeling or supporting
statues have listened to the plays
of Aristophanes or Sophocles, and
have beheld innumerable audiences occupying
the marble seats which still
confront them. Alas! What have they
not beheld here since those glorious
days! In this, the earliest home of
tragedy, how many tragedies have
been enacted! Directly opposite this
parapet is one of the ancient marble seats. It was occupied
by an Athenian magistrate more than two thousand years ago.
His name is still inscribed upon it,—perfectly legible, and
defiant of the touch of Time. Standing in this amphitheatre,
one realizes as never before, how, in an epoch of great intellectual
activity, genius does
not confine itself to one
particular line. Whether it
be the age of Pericles, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_253' name='Page_253' href='#Page_253'>253</a></span>
Renaissance, the era of Elizabeth, or the magnificent century
of the Moors, a wave of mental energy rolls over an entire
nation. Thus here, at Athens, it was not only sculpture that
attained such excellence, but painting; not only painting but
architecture; not only architecture but oratory; not only
oratory but philosophy;
and in
addition to all
these, this wonderful
city gave
mankind the
drama, so perfect
at the start
that even the
modern world,
with all its literary
culture and
experience, regards
the old
Greek dramatists
as its masters.
Filled with
such thoughts,
one seems to
see, while lingering
here, the
form of Sophocles,
the greatest of Greek tragic poets. For more than two
thousand three hundred years his plays have been admired
as almost perfect models of dramatic composition. There
is hardly a university in the world that has not one of his
magnificent tragedies in its curriculum of study. His play of
"Œdipus the King," which is so well interpreted by the
French actor, Mounet Sully, is still a masterpiece of strength
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_254' name='Page_254' href='#Page_254'>254</a></span>
and majesty; and all his other
plays, together with those of
Æschylus, Euripides, and Aristophanes,
have in their lofty sentiments
never been surpassed, unless,
indeed, by those of Shakespeare.
Inspired by the memory of
these Hellenic heroes, I approached
(still almost in the shadow
of the Acropolis) a rocky ledge,
known as the "Platform of Demosthenes."
Rough and unshapely
though it be, in view of
all that has transpired on its
summit it is of greater value to
the world than if the entire hill
were paved with gold and studded
with the rarest gems. From this rock the orators of
Athens spoke to the assembled people. Before it then was
the Athenian market-place,—the forum of the city. The
site is perfectly
identified, and
one can look
upon the very
spot from which
Demosthenes
delivered his
orations, still
unsurpassed in
ancient or in
modern times
even by those
of Cicero and
Burke.

Leaving this noble relic of the past, I presently stood
before a solitary gate, known as "The Arch of Hadrian." It
was, in fact, erected
here by that
Roman emperor in
the second century
after Christ, when
Greece was but a
province of the
Cæsars. In Italy
this would seem
to us of great antiquity;
but amid
objects such as I
had just beheld,
it appeared comparatively
modern. On one side of this portal is the inscription,
"This is Athens, the old City of Theseus." On the
other are the words, "This is the new City of Hadrian,
not that of Theseus." In fact this gateway was a barrier,
yet a connecting link, between the Grecian and the
Roman Athens,—the cities of the conquered and the conqueror.

<p>
Looking through this historic arch, I saw a group of stately
columns in the distance. They are the only relics that remain
of the great Temple of Olympian Jove. Even the writers of
antiquity, familiar though they were with splendid structures,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_256' name='Page_256' href='#Page_256'>256</a></span>
speak of that
shrine as being
awe-inspiring in
its grandeur.
With the exception
of the
Temple of
Diana at Ephesus,
it was the
largest Grecian
temple ever
built. There
were, originally,
at least one hundred and twenty-six of these Corinthian
columns. They formed almost a marble forest. Within
it was a veritable maze of statues, including one of Jupiter,
which was world-renowned; but these, as well as nearly all the
columns, have long since been abstracted
or destroyed.
</p>

<p>
These marble giants do not form a
single group. Two of them stand apart,
like sentries stationed to give warning
of the fresh approach of the despoiler.
Between them one column lies
prostrate; a sad reminder of the
fate that has overtaken so many
of its brethren. However, unlike
most other ruins in the world,
this was not caused by the
maliciousness of man. On the
night of the 26th of October,
1852, a heavy rainstorm undermined
the soil at its base, and
the huge column, overcome
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_257' name='Page_257' href='#Page_257'>257</a></span>
at last, fell its full length of sixty feet upon the sand. It
is interesting to observe how evenly its massive sections still
rest upon the ground, like bricks set up in rows to push each
other over in their fall.
</p>

<p>
It is said that the prostrate column could be restored, but
perhaps it is more eloquent as it lies. The shaft above it,
with its beautiful Corinthian capital, presents a striking contrast.
One seems proudly to say, "See
what this noble temple was!" the other
to murmur pathetically, "See what it
is to-day!"

Continuing my way still farther
round the base of the Acropolis, I
presently perceived a low-browed hill,
partially covered with a rocky ledge.
It was the ancient Areopagus, or Hill
of Mars. Here the Supreme Court of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_258' name='Page_258' href='#Page_258'>258</a></span>
Athens held its sessions.
Such was the
simple grandeur of the
old Athenians that the
only covering of this
court-room was the
canopy of heaven.
For the immortal gods
no temple could be
too magnificent; but
for the serious business
of deciding life
and death the Greeks would have no sumptuous decoration.
The sessions of the court were always held at night, so that
no face or gesture could exert the slightest influence. It
must have been a scene of wonderful solemnity, for here
accusers and accused stood, as it were, between their venerable
judges and the gods, while in the dome of
night a cloud of glittering witnesses looked
down upon them from illimitable space.

St. Paul ascended to address the Athenian audience which
gathered before him. Above him, as he spoke, rose the
whole glory of
the Acropolis,
with its magnificent
temples
and bewildering
array of
statues. And
yet this stranger
dared to
utter the impressive
words,
"God dwelleth not in temples made with hands." This in
the shadow of the Parthenon! "We ought not to think
that the Godhead is like unto gold or silver, or stone graven
by art and man's device." This in the presence of the
works of Phidias!

When we remember how the Acropolis must then have
looked, we cannot wonder that the Athenians who heard
these words spoken
within its shadow
smiled, and ironically
answered,
"We will hear thee
again of this matter!"
Well, Athens
has heard him
again, and so has the
entire world. Paul
discoursed here for possibly an hour, but what he said has
ever since been echoing down the ages. None knew him then;
but in a few short years, to the church founded by him in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_262' name='Page_262' href='#Page_262'>262</a></span>

which may be read in every language of the civilized
world; and now there is hardly a city in all Christendom that
has not a cathedral or church bearing the great Apostle's
name.

<p>
Not far from this historic spot is another ledge of great
antiquity. Here dungeons have been excavated in the solid
rock, one of them being called the "Prison of Socrates."
Opinions differ as to its authenticity; just as men still dispute
about the exact locality where Jesus hung upon the Cross.
But of the general situation in each case there is no doubt.
In Athens, as in Jerusalem, one stands in close proximity to
where the purest souls this earth has ever known were put to
death by those who hated them; and somewhere on this hill,
four hundred years before the scene of Calvary, Socrates
drank the poisoned cup forced upon him by his enemies, and
in that draught found immortality.
</p>

<p>
The lineaments of Christ's face are not surely known to
us, but those of Socrates have been preserved in marble.
His was a plain and homely visage. The playwright, Aristophanes,
caricatured him on the stage, and moved the audience
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_263' name='Page_263' href='#Page_263'>263</a></span>
to shouts of laughter; but, with the exception
of the Nazarene, no man
ever spoke like Socrates. He
was a natural teacher of men.
He walked daily among the
temples or in the market-place,
talking with every one
who cared to listen to him.
His method was unique. It
was, by asking searching questions,
to force men to think,—to
know themselves. If he
could make an astonished man
give utterance to an original
thought, he was contented for that
day. He had sown the seed; it
would bear fruit. He had no notes,
nor did he ever write a line; yet
his incomparable thoughts, expressed
in purest speech, were faithfully recorded by his
pupils, Xenophon and Plato, and will be treasured to the end
of time.

Another memorial of Athens which well repays a visit is
the Temple of Theseus,—that legendary hero of old Greece,
half-man, half-god, whose exploits
glimmer through the dawn of history,
much as a mountain partially
reveals itself through morning mists.
Fortune has treated this old temple
kindly. There is hardly an ancient
structure extant that has so perfectly
resisted the disintegrating
touch of time or the destroying
hand of man. For the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_264' name='Page_264' href='#Page_264'>264</a></span>
Theseum was built nearly five hundred years before the birth
of Christ, in commemoration of the glorious battle of Marathon,
where Theseus was believed to have appeared to aid the
Greeks in driving from their shores the invading Persians.
</p>

<p>
When in 1824 Lord Byron died upon Greek soil, striving
to free the Hellenic nation from the Turkish yoke, the Athenians
wished his body to be buried in this temple. No wonder
they were grateful to him, for the action of that ardent
admirer of the Greeks in hastening to their land to consecrate
his life and fortune to the cause of liberty, was not, as some
have thought, unpractical and sentimental. Byron, unlike
many other poets, was no mere dreamer. He could, when he
desired, descend from Poesy's empyrean to the practical realities
of life; and during his short stay in Greece, whether he
was securing loans, conciliating angry chiefs, or giving counsel
to the government, he showed the tact and firmness of an able
statesman.
</p>

<p>
As if, then, this classic temple were a Greek sarcophagus,
within which was enshrined the form of the immortal dead,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_265' name='Page_265' href='#Page_265'>265</a></span>
I seemed to see among its marble
columns that noble statue representing
Byron at Missolonghi, the
little town where, with such fatal
haste, his life was sacrificed. It
would be difficult to imagine anything
more distressing than Byron's
last illness. He was in a wretched,
malarial district, utterly devoid of
comforts. No woman's hand was
there to smooth his brow or give
to him the thousand little comforts
which only woman's tender
thoughtfulness can understand.
Convinced at last by the distress
of his servants that his death was
near, he called his faithful valet, Fletcher, to his side,
and spoke with great earnestness, but very indistinctly, for
nearly twenty minutes. Finally he said, with relief, "Now
I have told you all."

<p>
"My lord," replied Fletcher, "I have not understood a
word you have been saying."
</p>

<p>
"Not understood me?"
exclaimed Lord Byron, with a
look of the utmost distress.
"What a pity! for it is too
late; all is over!"
</p>

<p>
"I hope not," answered
Fletcher, "but the Lord's
will be done."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, not mine," said the
poet; and soon after murmured,
"Now I shall go to
sleep." These were the last
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_266' name='Page_266' href='#Page_266'>266</a></span>
words of Byron, for, with a weary sigh, he then sank into
that peaceful slumber in which his spirit gradually loosed its
hold on earth, and drifted outward into the Unknown.

<p class="caption">MAID OF ATHENS.</p>
</div>

<p>
The more modern part of Athens recalls happier recollections
of Byron. When he came here in his youth, he not only
wrote those magnificent stanzas
in "Childe Harold," which are
among the choicest treasures of
our English tongue, but also
composed that graceful poem,
"Maid of Athens," each verse
of which ends with Greek words
that signify, "My Life, I love
thee!" It was addressed to the
eldest daughter of the Greek
lady in whose house he lodged.
Little did that fair Athenian girl
imagine that his verses would
make her known throughout the world. Yet so it was. No
actual likeness of her can be given, but we may well believe
that she, in some respects, resembled a typical Grecian
maiden of to-day.

The tourist who visits Greece to-day finds much to
admire in the modern city which ancient Athens wears now
like a jewel on her withered breast. It is a bright, attractive
place. When I revisited it a few years ago, it seemed to
me by contrast with the Orient a miniature Paris. Yet this
is all of very recent growth. Half a century ago the devastation
wrought here by the Turks had left the city desolate.
Hardly a house in the whole town was habitable. But now
we find a city of one hundred and thirty thousand people,
with handsome residences, public squares, clean streets, and
several public buildings that would adorn any capital in the
world.
</p>

One of the finest private residences in Athens is the home
of the late Doctor Schliemann, the world-renowned explorer of
the plain of Troy and other sites of
Greek antiquity. It
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_268' name='Page_268' href='#Page_268'>268</a></span>
is constructed of pure Pentelic marble. Around its roof
beautiful groups of statuary gleam white against the blue of the
Athenian sky. Anywhere else this style of decoration would
perhaps seem out of place; not so in Athens. It simply serves
as a reminder of the fact that once the wealth of art here was so
great that half the galleries of the world are filled to-day with
the fragments of it that remain. So many statues once existed
here, that
an Athenian
wit declared
that it was
easier to find a
god in Athens
than a man!

Perhaps the
finest of the
public buildings
in Athens
is its Academy
of Science. It is
a noble structure,
composed
entirely of Pentelic marble and built in imitation of the
classic style, with rows of grand Ionic columns, while in the
pediment are sculptures resembling those with which the
Greeks two thousand years ago adorned the shrines of the
Acropolis. The lofty marble columns in the foreground are
crowned with figures of Minerva and Apollo. Below them
are the seated statues of Socrates and Plato. What more
appropriate combination could be made than this: the wisdom
of the gods above, the wisdom of humanity below, expressed
by the greatest names which in religion and philosophy have
given Athens an immortal fame? In the spring of 1896
modern Athens seemed suddenly to surpass the ancient
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_271' name='Page_271' href='#Page_271'>271</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_270' name='Page_270' href='#Page_270'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_269' name='Page_269' href='#Page_269'></a></span>
city in interest, through the revival of the Olympian games.
The mention of these famous contests suggests at once
the old Greek statue of the Disk-Thrower, whose arm
has been uplifted for the admiration of the world for
more than two thousand years. Although this national
festival of the Greeks had its origin nearly eight hundred
years before the birth of Christ, and though the last one
was celebrated fifteen hundred years ago, the games were
renewed in 1896 as the first of a series of international athletic
contests, which will hereafter take place every four years in
various portions of the world. The first was given, of course,
to Greece, the mother of athletics as she was of art. The
next will be seen at Paris in 1900, during the Exposition
there.

<p>
For the great occasion referred to, the old Greek Stadium
was partially re-excavated and furnished with hundreds of
new marble seats. This was done not alone at the expense of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_272' name='Page_272' href='#Page_272'>272</a></span>
a few rich Athenians, but
also through the generosity
of wealthy Greeks in
Alexandria, Smyrna, London,
and Marseilles. The
Stadium, as it now exists,
can accommodate about
sixty thousand people;
and on the closing day of
the recently revived festival,
fully that number
were assembled in it,
while forty thousand more
were grouped outside the
walls or on the road
between Athens and the
battlefield of Marathon. Among the contesting athletes
were several manly specimens of "Young
America." In every way they did us honor.
Those with whom we talked on the subject
spoke in the highest terms of the
courtesy and kindness shown them by
every one in Athens, from king to peasant.
Nor was this strange. It was
due, first, to their own fine qualities;
second, to the popularity which America
enjoys in Greece, and third, to the fact
that they themselves soon proved the
heroes of the Stadium.
</p>

<p>
After each contest, the flag of the
victorious country was displayed above
the arena, and the American emblem
was the first to go up. And it kept
going up! The first three races were all
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_273' name='Page_273' href='#Page_273'>273</a></span>
won by Americans. Then came the "long jump," which
Americans also gained. Then Garrett, of Princeton, beat
the Greeks themselves at their old classic sport of "throwing
the disk." Even on the second day "Old Glory"
shook out its starry folds three times, till presently Denmark
gained a victory, and then England.
</p>

<p class="caption">THE STADIUM.</p>
</div>

<p>
It is hard to single out for special notice any one individual
among these heroes; but no American gained more popularity
on the historic race-course, than the man who for swift
running carried off so many prizes in Old Athens,—that lithe
citizen of the "Athens of America," Thomas Burke. Over
his speed and skill the Greeks were wildly enthusiastic.
Some of them showed him proofs of personal affection. One
asked him, through an interpreter, on what food he had been
trained. Burke, like a true Bostonian, replied, "Beans!"
After one of his brilliant victories, when the Americans
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_274' name='Page_274' href='#Page_274'>274</a></span>
had gained in swift succession four first prizes, one old Athenian
stood up in the Stadium, and raising his hands in mock
despair, exclaimed: "O, why did Columbus ever discover
that country!"
</p>

<p>
Finally, on the last day, there came a contest which the
Greeks had been awaiting with alternating hope and fear. It
was the long run from the battlefield of Marathon to Athens,—a
distance of twenty-five miles.
</p>

<p>
Besides the Greeks, there entered for this race Americans,
Australians, Frenchmen, Germans, and Hungarians. Secretly,
however, almost every one of the spectators hoped that a
Greek would win. History and sentiment alike seemed to
demand that the coveted honor should be gained by a
descendant of the men of Marathon, for this was the same
road traversed by the historic Greek, who ran to announce
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_275' name='Page_275' href='#Page_275'>275</a></span>
to the Athenians the triumph of the
Greeks over the Persians at Marathon,
and as he entered the
Arena, dropped dead, gasping
the word, "Victory!"

<p>
Instinctively that scene
rises before the reader's imagination,
as it must have done
before the minds of the thousands
gathered on the course
to witness the issue of the race.
It was half-past four in the afternoon
when a cannon-shot announced
that the leading runner
was in sight. Two or three minutes passed in breathless
silence. No one moved or spoke. Suddenly, a far-off cry
was heard, "It is a Greek—a Greek!" These words were
taken up and ran the whole
length of the Stadium as electricity
leaps from point to
point. A moment
more, and a hundred
thousand voices rent
the air with cheers and
acclamations. The
king himself almost
tore the visor from his
cap, waving it frantically
round his
head; for, in truth,
the victor <i>was a
Greek</i>,—a young
peasant named
Loues, twenty-four
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_276' name='Page_276' href='#Page_276'>276</a></span>
years of age. Before entering the contest,
he had partaken of the sacrament
and had invoked the aid of Heaven;
and apparently the gods had come to
his assistance, for he had made the run
of twenty-five miles over a hard, rough
country in <i>two hours and forty-five minutes</i>!
To show the feeling the victor
entertained for the American athletes,
it may be said that when Loues crossed
the line, notwithstanding the tremendous
excitement and enthusiasm that
prevailed, he ran to Tom Burke, and,
throwing his arms around him, kissed the American flag
which the Bostonian was holding in his hand.
</p>

</div>

<p>
At the king's palace, Loues and the other competing
athletes were entertained in royal style by the crowned head
of the kingdom. The joy and pride of the young peasant's
father, as he saw him universally fêted
and admired, is said to have been extremely
beautiful and touching; for
Loues was treated almost as a demigod
by his delighted countrymen.
The strangest gifts were showered
upon him. A café, for example,
offered him <i><span lang="fr_FR">carte blanche</span></i> at its
hospitable table for the rest of
his life; a barber-shop promised
him free shaves so long as he
lived; and even a boot-black
coveted the honor of polishing
his shoes for an indefinite period,
expecting nothing in return.
Large sums of money also were
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_277' name='Page_277' href='#Page_277'>277</a></span>
offered him; but these, with the true spirit of the athlete,
Loues declined. "The only reward I crave," he exclaimed,
"is the wreath of laurel from Olympia, such as my ancestors
received two thousand years ago. I am poor, but I ran,
not for money, but for the glory of my native land."

<p>
The pleasantest route in taking leave of the Hellenic
kingdom is to embark upon a steamer
and sail through the Grecian Archipelago.
It is the same route taken
by the old Greek colonists when they
went forth to civilize the world,—the
same path followed by the Trojan
exiles when they sailed to Italy to
build upon her seven hills the walls of
Rome. To coast along the shores
of the Ægean, after a tour in Athens,
is one of the most exquisite enjoyments
this life can give. To the student
of history in particular, the scene
recalls events so glorious that he is
lost in admiration, not only of the
marvelous country as a whole, but of
what the ancient Greeks accomplished
for humanity. In what department did they not excel?
</p>

<p>
Is it their sculpture that we question? At once the
incomparable Venus of Melos makes reply; that statue found
(alas! in partial ruin) on one of the islands that are scattered
broadcast on this classic sea, like disentangled pearls, and
hence a fitting emblem of those treasures of antiquity cast
on the shores of time after a long-continued and disastrous
storm.
</p>

<p>
Is it their language? It was the most perfect and elastic
tongue in which men's lips have ever fashioned speech. It
seems more than chance that caused it, at the birth of Christ,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_278' name='Page_278' href='#Page_278'>278</a></span>
to be the leading literary language
of the world, that it might thus
receive, embody, and perpetuate
the truths of the New Testament.
Even now we turn to that old
tongue to find exact expression for
our terms of science, and in it we
name all our new inventions such
as heliotypes and photographs,
the telegraph and the telephone.

<img src="images/i-289.jpg" width="311" height="389" alt="" />
<p class="caption">HOMER.</p>
</div>

<p>
Is it poetry? At once there
seems to rise before us from these
waters, which encircled him at birth
and death, the face of Homer,—the
father of poetry. To whom has he not been a joy and
inspiration? Virgil was but the pupil and imitator of Homer.
And the Iliad and Odyssey are still such storehouses of
eloquence and beauty, that such statesmen as Gladstone
and the Earl of Derby have sharpened their keen intellects
in making their translations.
</p>

<p>
Is it philosophy? "Out of Plato," says
Emerson, "come all things that are still
written and debated among men of
thought."

<p>
The lesson, then, which Athens
teaches us is this: not to regard past
men, past deeds, and ruined shrines as
dead and useless limbs upon the Tree
of Time. The Past has made the
Present, just as the Present is now
fashioning Futurity. Moreover, since
one lofty sentiment begets another;
one valiant deed inspires a second;
and one sublime achievement is a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_279' name='Page_279' href='#Page_279'>279</a></span>
stepping-stone to loftier heights; what portion of our earth
can give to us more inspiration than Athens,—birthplace of
the earliest masterpieces of the human race, the mother of
imperishable memories, and of an art that conquers time.

<p>
Venice is still victorious over Time. Despite her age,
the City of the Sea is fascinating still. She has successfully
defied a dozen centuries; she may perhaps
defy as many more. All other cities in the world resemble
one another. Venice remains unique. She is the City
of Romance—the only place on earth to-day where Poetry
conquers Prose. The marriage of the
Adriatic and its bride has never been
dissolved. She is to-day, as
she has been for fourteen
hundred years, a capital
whose streets are water and
whose vehicles are boats.
She is an incomparable illustration
of the poetical and
the picturesque; and, were
she nothing else, would still
attract the world. But she
is infinitely more. The
hands of Titian and Tintoretto
have embellished her.
She wears upon her breast some architectural jewels unsurpassed
in Italy. And, finally, the splendor of her history enfolds
her like the glory of her golden sunsets, and she emerges
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_284' name='Page_284' href='#Page_284'>284</a></span>
from the waves of Time, that have repeatedly endeavored to
engulf her, as do her marble palaces from the encircling sea.

<p class="caption">THE RAILWAY STATION.</p>
</div>

<p>
The charm of Venice begins even at what is usually the
most prosaic of places—a railway station. For, to a city
where there are no living horses, the iron horse at least has made
its way; and by a bridge, two miles in length, Venice is now
connected with the outer world by rail. A quick, delicious
feeling of surprise comes over one to see awaiting him in the
place of carriages a multitude of boats. The pleasing sense
of novelty (so rare now in the world) appeals to us at once,
and, with the joyful consciousness of entering on a long-anticipated
pleasure, we seat ourselves within a gondola, and
noiselessly and swiftly glide out into the unknown.

<p class="caption">A LIQUID LABYRINTH.<br />
"LIKE A HUGE SEA-WALL."</p>
</div>

<p>
The first surprise awaiting almost every visitor to Venice
is that of seeing all its buildings rise directly from the sea.
He knows, of course, that Venice rests upon a hundred islands,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_287' name='Page_287' href='#Page_287'>287</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_286' name='Page_286' href='#Page_286'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_285' name='Page_285' href='#Page_285'></a></span>
linked by four hundred and fifty bridges. Hence, he expects
to see between the houses and the liquid streets some fringe
of earth, some terrace or embankment. But no:—the stately
mansions emerge from the ocean like a huge sea-wall, and,
when the surface of the water is disturbed
by a light breeze or passing boat,
it overflows their marble
steps as softly as the
ultimate ripple of
the surf spreads its
white foam along
the beach. As,
then, our gondolier
takes us farther through this
liquid labyrinth, we naturally
ask in astonishment, "What
was the origin of this mysterious
city? How came it
to be founded thus within the
sea?" The wonder is easily
explained. In the fifth century
after Christ, when the old Roman empire had well-nigh
perished under the deadly inroads of barbarians, another
devastating army entered Italy, led by a man who was
regarded as the "scourge of God." This man was Attila.
Such was the ruin always left behind him, that he could
boast with truth that the grass grew not where his horse had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_288' name='Page_288' href='#Page_288'>288</a></span>
trod. A few men seeking to escape this vandal, fled to a
group of uninhabited islands in the Adriatic. Exiled from
land, they cast themselves in desperation on the sea.

<p class="caption">THE OCEAN CITY.</p>
</div>

<p>
But no one can behold this ocean-city without perceiving
that those exiles were rewarded for their courage. The
sea became their mother,—their divinity. She sheltered
them with her encircling waves. She nourished them from
her abundant life. She forced them to build boats in which
to transport merchandise from land to land. And they, obeying
her, grew from a feeble colony of refugees to be a powerful
republic, and made their city a nucleus of vast wealth and
commerce,—a swinging door between the Orient and Occident,
through which there ebbed and flowed for centuries a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_289' name='Page_289' href='#Page_289'>289</a></span>

wealth, of which
her glorious sunsets
seemed but
the reflection.

Who can forget
his first
glimpse of the
Grand Canal?
Seen at a favorable
hour, the
famous thoroughfare
delights the
senses as it thrills
the heart. For
two miles it winds through the city in such graceful lines
that every section of its course reveals a stately curve. Upon
this beautiful expanse the sun of Venice, like a cunning
necromancer, displays most marvelous effects of light and
shade, transforming it at different hours of the day into
an avenue of lapis-lazuli, or emerald, or gold,—an eloquent
reminder of the
time when Venice
was a paradise of
pleasure, when life
upon its liquid
streets was a perpetual
pageant,
and this incomparable
avenue its
splendid promenade.
Its curving
banks are lined
with palaces.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_290' name='Page_290' href='#Page_290'>290</a></span>
They seem to be standing hand in hand, saluting one another
gravely, as though both shores were executing here the movements
of some courtly dance. These were originally the homes
of men whose names were written in that record of Venetian
nobility, called "The Book of Gold." Once they were marvels
of magnificence; and viewed in the sunset light, or by the
moon, they are so still. Under that enchanting spell their
massive columns, marble balconies, and elegantly sculptured
arches, seem as imposing as when the Adriatic's Bride was
still a queen and wore her robes of purple and of gold.

<p>
To build such structures on the shifting sands was a stupendous
undertaking; and what we cannot see of these Venetian
palaces has cost much more than that which rises now
above the waves. From every door broad marble steps
descend to the canal, and tall posts, painted with the colors
of the family, serve as a mooring place for gondolas, a kind
of marine <i>porte cochère</i>. Each of these structures has its

But now our winding course reveals
to us, suspended over this noble
thoroughfare, a structure which we
recognize at once—"The Bridge of
the Rialto." For centuries this was
the only bridge that crossed the Grand Canal. An ugly one
of iron has been constructed near the railway station; but
this Rialto remains a relic of Venice in her glory, for its huge
arch is entirely
of marble, and
has a length of
over a hundred
and fifty feet.
Its cost exceeded
half a million
dollars; and the
foundations,
which for three
hundred and
twenty years
have faithfully
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_294' name='Page_294' href='#Page_294'>294</a></span>
supported it, are twelve thousand trunks of elm trees, each
ten feet in length. To-day, little shops are built along the
bridge, leaving a passageway between them in the centre and
one without on either side.

<p>
The Rialto seems prosaic
in the glare of noon. But
wave before it, for an instant,
the magic wands of
fancy and historical association,
and we can picture to
ourselves how it must have
looked when on this Rivo-Alto,
or "High Bank,"
which gives the bridge its name, Venetian ladies saw outspread
before them the treasures of the Orient; when at this
point the laws of the Republic were proclaimed; when merchants
congregated here as to a vast Exchange; and when,
on this same bridge, the forms of Shylock and Othello may
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_295' name='Page_295' href='#Page_295'>295</a></span>
have stood out in sharp relief against the sky; when, in a
word, Venice, like Venus, had been born of the blue sea,
possessing all the fascinating languor of the East, and yet
belonging to the restless West. But to acquire
that mental state in which
these visions of Venetian
splendor will recur
to one, certain
conditions are
essential for the tourist: first, he must choose the moon for
his companion; and, second, he must manage to arrive in
the City of the Sea by night. Venice, though beautiful,
shows marks of age. The glare of day is far too strong for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_296' name='Page_296' href='#Page_296'>296</a></span>
her pathetically
fair, but wrinkled,
face. Pay her the
compliment to see
her at her best.
In Venice make
your nights and
days exchange
places. Sleep
through the
morning hours,
and spend the
afternoons reading
books that tell
of old Venetian
glory. Then, when the daylight wanes, and the moon turns
these streets into paths of shimmering gold, go forth to woo
<i>Venezia</i>, and she will give you of her best.

absolute tranquility upon a noiseless sea.
</p>

<p>
To go to another city after Venice is like removing from
one's ears the fingers which for a little time had closed them
to all sounds. No place is better for a weary brain-worker
than Venice. His nerves relax in its restful stillness. The
hand of Nature gently lifts the veil from his hot, wearied eyes;
and he perceives at last that when a comfortable livelihood
has been secured, to keep on toiling feverishly in the modern
world, beneath a pall of soot and in the midst of noisy, heartless
crowds, is not to live: it is merely preparing to die.

<p class="caption">A FAMILIAR SCENE.</p>
</div>

<p>
Upon a moonlit night these liquid corridors present a scene
too beautiful for words. It is the Venice of one's dreams.
According to the light or shade, we glide through alternating
paths of glory and of gloom. All the defects which day
reveals are, by moonlight, totally concealed or softened into
indistinctness, like features hidden by a silvery veil. Here
and there some lights are gleaming through the casements;
but, as a rule, the city seems to sleep.
</p>

<p>
Occasionally, it may be, a boat full of musicians will appear,
and, to the passionate throbbing of the harp or guitar, a score
of voices chant the songs of Italy. Meanwhile, a dozen gondolas,
with listening occupants, float in the shadows of the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_300' name='Page_300' href='#Page_300'>300</a></span>
marble palaces. These, when the music ceases, approach the
expectant singers, and silver coins fall into outstretched hands,
which glisten phantom-like for a moment in the moonlight.
Then each gondola, with swan-like grace, in silence disappears,
leaving behind it a long furrow like a chain of gold.
</p>

<p class="caption">THE HEART OF VENICE.</p>
</div>

<p>
When the visitor
to Venice prepares
to leave for
a time his gondola,
there is no
need to say where
he will land.
There is one little
area more
important than
all others, which
every tourist longs to see and explore. It is a perfectly
familiar scene, yet I have often noticed, with a thrill of sympathy,
a tremor in the voice of the enthusiastic traveler who
sees it for the first time, as he exclaims: "That building
on the right is surely the Ducal Palace, and on the left is the
entrance to the Piazzetta."
</p>

<p>
"That lofty tower is, of course, the Campanile. But where
is St. Mark's?"
</p>

<p>
"It is just behind the Ducal Palace, and invisible from this
point."
</p>

<p>
"And the famous Piazza?"
</p>

<p>
"That, too, is hidden behind the building on the left, but
it is at right angles with the Piazzetta, and lies within the
shadow of the Campanile."
</p>

<p>
As one draws nearer to the spot, how marvelously beautiful
it all appears! Now one begins to appreciate the splendor
of the Doge's Palace. Above it, like a constellation
rising from the sea, glitter the domes of the Cathedral of San
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_301' name='Page_301' href='#Page_301'>301</a></span>
Marco. Presently the long landing-pier and the attractive
Piazzetta are distinctly visible; and, turning one's astonished
vision heavenward, one looks with admiration on the splendid
bell-tower, three hundred and fifty feet in height, its pointed
summit piercing the light clouds and its aerial balcony hung
like a gilded cage against the sky. The traveler who beholds
these scenes may have had many delightful moments in his life,
but that in which he looks for the first time upon this glorious
combination of the historic and the beautiful can hardly be
surpassed. Like the names of the old Venetian nobles, it
should be written in a "Book of Gold."
</p>

<p class="caption">THE DOGE'S PALACE.</p>
</div>

<p>
On the border of the Piazzetta are two stately columns.
On landing, therefore, one naturally gives to them one's first
attention. It is difficult to realize that these granite monoliths
have been standing here for more than seven hundred
years, but such is the fact, as they were erected in the year
1187. They were a portion of the spoils brought back by
the Venetians from the treasure-laden East. Each upholds
the emblem of a patron saint: one, a statue of St.
Theodore, the other, the famous winged lion of St. Mark.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_302' name='Page_302' href='#Page_302'>302</a></span>
Formerly, on a scaffold reared between these columns, state
criminals were put to death—their backs turned toward the
land which casts them from her, their faces toward the
sea, symbol of
eternity. But
now the shadows
of these ancient
shafts fall on a
multitude of
pleasure-boats,
and echo to the
voices of the gondoliers.
Close by
these columns is
the Ducal Palace,—that
splendid
symbol of Venetian
glory,—a
record of the
city's brilliant
history preserved
in stone.
This spot, for
more than a
thousand years,
was the residence
of the Doges, Five palaces preceded this, each in turn
having been destroyed by fire. But every time a more magnificent
building rose from the ashes of its predecessor. The
present structure has been standing for nearly five hundred
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_305' name='Page_305' href='#Page_305'>305</a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_304' name='Page_304' href='#Page_304'></a></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_303' name='Page_303' href='#Page_303'></a></span>
years, and from the variety of architectural styles mingled
here from North, South, East and West, Ruskin called it,
"The Central Building of the World."
</p>

</div>

<p>
Around it, on two sides, are long arcades of marble columns,
the lower ones adorned with sculptures in relief, the
upper ones ending in graceful circles pierced with quatrefoils.
Above them is the crowning glory of the building,—a beautiful
expanse of variegated marble, with intricate designs running
diagonally over its surface. At every corner the twisted
column of Byzantine architecture is observed, and on the
border of the roof a fringe of pinnacles and pointed arches
cuts its keen silhouette against the sky. The lower columns
seem perhaps a trifle short, but this is because the building
has gradually settled toward the sea, as if unable to support
the burden of its years and memories.
</p>

<p>
By day this palace is superbly beautiful; but, in the
evening, when illumined by the moon, or flooded with electric
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_306' name='Page_306' href='#Page_306'>306</a></span>
light, it is, perhaps, the most imposing structure in the
whole of Europe. At such a time it looks like an immense
sarcophagus of precious stone, in which the glories of old
Venice lie entombed. The colonnades around the Ducal
Palace give perfect shelter
from the sun or rain,
and hundreds stroll here
through the day, having
the somber palace on
the one side, and, on the
other, all the gaiety of
the Grand Canal. But
in the evening, when
the adjoining St. Mark's
Square is thronged with
promenaders, and music
floats upon the air, the
arcade is to the Piazza
what a conservatory is
to a ball-room. Lovers
invariably find such
places, for not even the
moonbeams can penetrate
these shadows.
At such a time the
promenades seem shadowy
lanes of love conducting
from the gay Piazza to the waiting gondola.

<p>
To know the past of the Ducal Palace thoroughly would
be to know the entire history of Venice, from its transcendent
glories to its darkest crimes. For this was not alone the
residence of the Doges; it was at different epochs the Senate-House,
the Court of Justice, a prison, and even a place of
execution. Fronting upon the courtyard, just beneath the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_307' name='Page_307' href='#Page_307'>307</a></span>
roof, the tourist sees some small,
round windows. They admit a little
light to a few cells, known as the
Piombi, or Leads, because they
were located just beneath the lead
roof of the palace. In summer
the heat in them is almost unendurable.
And yet in one of them
the Italian patriot and poet, Silvio
Pellico, seventy years ago, was
kept a wretched captive, and he
has related the sad story of his
sufferings in his famous book, <i>Le
mie Prigioni</i>, or "My Prisons."

It is but a step from the outer

marble walls enclose this, and one instinctively looks up to
see the splendid robes of Senators light up the sculptured
colonnades, and the rich toilettes of the Venetian ladies
trail upon the marble stairways. But no! This square,
whose walls have echoed to the footsteps
of the Doges, now guards
a solemn silence. In its pathetic,
voiceless beauty, it

Beyond these,
one observes a marble
staircase leading
to the second story.
It is imposing when
one stands before it. Above it frowns the winged lion of St.
Mark, as if to challenge all who dare set foot upon these
steps. Stationed like sentinels to the right and left are two
colossal statues representing Mars and Neptune, which have
indeed given the name, "The Giants' Staircase," to this
thoroughfare of marble. Their
stony silence is almost oppressive.
Think of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_309' name='Page_309' href='#Page_309'>309</a></span>
the splendid pageants
and historic scenes
which they have
looked upon, but
which their unimpassioned
lips will ne'er
describe! Between
these figures, on the
topmost stair, amid a
scene of splendor
which even the greatest
of Venetian artists
could only faintly represent,
the Doges
were inaugurated into sovereignty. Here they pronounced
their solemn oath of office; and one of them, Marino Faliero,
having betrayed his trust, was here beheaded for his crime.
It will be remembered that Byron's tragedy of Marino
Faliero closes with the line:

When one has passed these marble giants and entered the
state apartments of the palace, despite the intimation given
by the outer walls, one is astonished at the splendor here
revealed. As the bright sunlight falls on the mosaic pavement,
it is easy to imagine that one is
walking on a beach whose
glittering sands are
grains of gold. The
roof and walls are
covered with enormous
masterpieces
set in golden frames.
All of them have
one theme—the glorification
of Venice.
One of
them, finished
by Tintoretto
when he was
more than three
score years and
ten, is seventy feet in length, and is the largest painting known
to art. One trembles to think what fire could accomplish
here in a single night, not only in this Ducal Palace, but in
the equally marvelous buildings which adjoin it; for they
could never be reproduced. They are unique in the world.

benches sat the Councilors
of the Republic wearing
their scarlet robes!
Upon their votes depended
life and death; and
here the die was cast for
peace or war. Close by
the door was placed a lion's
head of marble, into the
mouth of which (the famous
<i>Bocca di Lione</i>) secret denunciations
were cast. These
were examined by the Council
of Ten, all of whose acts were
shrouded in profoundest secrecy;
and such at last was their despotic
power that even the Doge himself came to be nothing but
the slave and mouthpiece of that group of tyrants, and was
as little safe from them as those whose sentences he automatically
signed.

While standing here, there naturally presents itself to
one's imagination a scene in the old days when, as the Doge
descended from his palace,
he met some lowly suppliant
presenting to him an appeal
for mercy. Ah, what a
glorious age was that for
Venice!—when her victorious
flag rolled out its purple
folds over the richest islands
of the Mediterranean and
the Adriatic; when she possessed
the largest armory
and the most extensive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_314' name='Page_314' href='#Page_314'>314</a></span>
dock-yards in the world (in which ten thousand beams of
oak were always ready for the construction of new ships);
when she could boast of having the first bank of deposit
ever founded in Europe; when (Rome excepted) she was the
first to print books in Italy; and when she sold in St. Mark's
Square the first newspaper ever known to the world, demanding
for it a little coin called <i>gazetta</i>, which has given us the
word "gazette."

Recalling these Venetian exploits, I stood one evening
in one of the most delightful places in all Venice,—the
upper balcony of the Ducal Palace. Lingering here and
looking out between the sculptured columns toward the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_315' name='Page_315' href='#Page_315'>315</a></span>
island of San Giorgio, I thought of the old times when every
year, upon Ascension Day, the Doge descended from this balcony
and stepped upon a barge adorned with canopies of gold
and velvet, and with a deck inlaid with ebony and mother-of-pearl.
Then, to the sound of martial music, that splendid
vessel swept out toward the sea, propelled by eighty gilded
oars; till, finally, amidst the roar of cannon and the shouts of
the assembled populace, the Doge cast into the blue waves a
ring of gold, exclaiming solemnly: "We wed thee, O Sea,
with this ring, emblem of our rightful and perpetual dominion."

But there was another side to this magnificent picture,
which dimmed the splendor of Venetian palaces. For just
behind the residence of the Doges, suspended over the canal,—"a
palace and a prison on each hand,"—is one of the best
known structures in the world,—the Bridge of Sighs. This
is indeed a sad memorial of tyranny. True, recent scoffers
at sentiment sneer at the associations of this bridge, and one
has even called it a "pathetic swindle." But, whether or
not the prisoners of Venice breathed through these grated
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_316' name='Page_316' href='#Page_316'>316</a></span>
windows a last sigh, as they relinquished life and liberty, certain
it is that in the building on the right, far down below
the water's edge, are some of the most horrible dungeons that
human cruelty has ever designed;
and any visitor to Venice may
cross this bridge and grope his
way down moldering flights of
stone steps to behold them.

All who have done so will
recollect those fetid cells, slimy
with dampness, shrouded in darkness,
and stifling from the exhausted
air which filters to them through the narrow corridors.
They will remember the iron grating through which
was passed the scanty food that for a time prolonged the prisoner's
life; the grooves of the old guillotine, by means of
which, after excruciating torture, he was put to death; and
then the narrow opening through
which the body was removed at
night and rowed out to a distant
spot, where it was death to cast
a net. Here, unillumined even
by a torch, it sank, freighted
with heavy stones, into the sea,
whose gloomy depths will guard
all secrets hidden in its breast
until its waters shall give up
their dead.

<p>
Connected with the Ducal
residence is the world-renowned
St. Mark's Cathedral. The old
Venetians built not only palaces for men; they made their
shrines to God palatial. I looked on this one with bewilderment.
There is no structure like it in the world. Its bulbous
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_319' name='Page_319' href='#Page_319'>319</a></span>

domes and minaret-like belfries remind one of the Orient. It
seems more like a Mohammedan than a Christian temple.
If the phrase be permitted, it is a kind of Christian mosque.
The truth is, the Venetians brought back from their victories
in the East ideas of Oriental architecture which had pleased
them, and were thus able to produce a wonderful blending of
Moorish, Arabic, and Gothic art.

What a façade is this! Here, massed in serried ranks, are
scores of variously colored marble columns, each one a monolith,
and all possessing an eventful history. Some are from
Ephesus, others from Smyrna, while others still are from Constantinople,
and more than one even from Jerusalem. On
one, the hand of Cleopatra may have rested; another may
have cast its shadow on St. Paul; a third may have been
looked upon by Jesus. St. Mark's is the treasure-house of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_320' name='Page_320' href='#Page_320'>320</a></span>
Venice,—a place
of pride as well as
of prayer. Here
was heaped up the
booty which she
gained from her
repeated conquests.
The
Doge's Palace
was the brain of
Venice; the Grand
Piazza was its
heart; but this
Cathedral was its
soul.

The work of beautifying this old church was carried on
enthusiastically for five hundred years. Each generation
tried to outdo all that had
preceded it. Again and
again Venetian fleets swept
proudly up the Adriatic,
laden with spoils destined
for this glorious shrine.
<i>Viva San Marco!</i> was the
watchword alike of her
armies and her navies; and
when the captains of Venetian
fleets came homeward
from the Orient, the first
inquiry put to them was
this: "What new and
splendid offering bring you
for San Marco?" The dust
of ages, therefore, may have
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_321' name='Page_321' href='#Page_321'>321</a></span>
gathered on this building, but it is, at least, the dust of
gold. Its domes and spires glisten with the yellow lustre.
It even gilds the four bronze horses which surmount its
portal. These are among the most interesting statues in
the world. We know not who the sculptor was that gave
them their apparent life; but it is certain that they were
carried to Rome and there attached to Nero's golden
chariot. In the fourth century after Christ the emperor
Constantine, when he transferred the seat of empire from
the Tiber to the Bosphorus, took them to Constantinople,
where for nine hundred years they proudly stood beside the
Golden Horn. Then, when that capital was plundered by
the Venetians, they were brought hither, and for five hundred
years they adorned the entrance to St. Mark's. Even here
their travels had not ended; for, a century ago, Napoleon,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_322' name='Page_322' href='#Page_322'>322</a></span>
when conqueror of Italy, caused them to be conveyed to
Paris, where, in the shadow of the Tuileries, they watched
the triumph of the modern Cæsar. But after Waterloo,
Venice once more claimed them
for her own.

It is an impressive moment
when one passes beneath these
gilded steeds and enters the
interior of the cathedral. A
twilight gloom pervades it, well
suited to its age and the mysterious
origin of all it contains.
The walls and roof are so profusely
covered with mosaics and
precious marbles that it is easy
to understand why St. Mark's
has been called the "Church of
Gold," and likened to a cavern
hung with stalactites
of precious stones. Some
of these ornaments are of
pagan origin; others have
come from Christian shrines.
All, however, have had to
pay their contribution to St. Mark's.
Thus Santa Sophia at Constantinople,
though still a Christian church and
dedicated to the Saviour, was plundered
to embellish the Venetian shrine
named after His apostle. Hence, it
is the literal truth that, overflowing
with the spoils of other cities and sanctuaries, St. Mark's is a
magnificent repository of booty—a veritable den of thieves.
In the most prominent position in the church is the receptacle

guarded by the
statues of the
twelve apostles,
where is kept, as
the most precious
of its treasures, the
body of St. Mark.
On one side is the
pulpit from which
the old Doge, Dandolo,
when ninety-three
years of age,
urged his people
to undertake the
fourth crusade.

"Men of Venice!" he exclaimed, "I am old and weak,
and I need rest, but I will go with you to rescue from the infidel
the Holy Sepulchre, and I will be victorious or lose my
life." Hearing these words, the assembled people made
these walls resound
with the
cry: "So be it!
Lead us on! For
God's sake go
with us!" Then
the old Doge
descended from

standing on the

received the

On leaving this marvelous structure,
one steps directly into the adjoining
St. Mark's Square. If it be the
hour of siesta, it will appear deserted.
Yet this has been for centuries the
Forum of Venetian life; the favorite
place for her festivities; the beautiful,
historic stage on which have been enacted
most of the scenes connected with her glorious past.
Around it are fine marble structures, which even now are used
for offices of State. Within these long arcades are the most
attractive shops in Venice, and, were there only a garden in
the centre, the place would remind one of the Palais Royal at
Paris, which was, in fact, built in imitation of this square.
To-day the popularity of the
Parisian square is waning,
since many of its gorgeous
shops have migrated to the
Rue de la Paix. But owing
to its situation, the attractiveness
of the Venetian
court can hardly be diminished.
While Venice lasts,
its glory must remain undimmed
by Time.

On summer evenings,

favorite rendezvous of all lovers and pleasure-seekers, whether
natives or foreigners. Here, several times a week, fine
military music floats upon the air, and hundreds of men and
women stroll along these marble blocks, which in the moonlight
seem as white as snow. Others, meantime, are seated
beneath the neighboring arches, sipping coffee or sherbet,
laughing and talking in the soft Venetian dialect, and, like
the Japanese, seeming to appreciate the mere joy of living, an
art which many of us, alas, have lost.

One pretty feature of this historic area is its pigeons.
Their homes are in the marble arches of the adjoining
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_328' name='Page_328' href='#Page_328'>328</a></span>
buildings; and shortly after midday, every afternoon, they
suddenly appear in great numbers; now rising in a pretty
cloud of fluttering wings; now grouped together like an undulating
wave of eider-down. Foreigners, in particular, love to
feed them; and
in return for the
kindness they
receive, the
pigeons at times
alight upon the
shoulders of a
stranger or courageously
pick
up crumbs from
outstretched
hands. It is
not strange that
Venice should
guard these birds so tenderly. Six centuries ago, when the
Venetians were blockading the island of Candia, the Doge's
officers observed that pigeons frequently flew above their
heads. Suspecting something, they contrived to shoot a few,
and each was found to have beneath its wing a message to
the enemy. Acting on information thus acquired, the Venetian
admiral made his attack at once and captured the island
in twelve hours. The carrier-pigeons which they found there
were therefore taken home to Venice and treated with the
utmost kindness, and their descendants have ever since been
favorites of the people.

On walking from the Piazza toward the Grand Canal, one
always finds at the extremity of the Piazzetta a line of waiting
gondolas. At once a shower of soft Italian syllables falls
musically on the air: "<span lang="it_IT">Una gondola, Signore! Commanda
una gondola; Una barca, Signore; Una bellissima barca;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_329' name='Page_329' href='#Page_329'>329</a></span>
Vuol' andare? Eccomi pronto!</span>" The speakers are Venetian
coachmen, and the contrast is a startling one between the
liquid vowels of their speech and the rasping cries of our
American drivers: "Want a cow-pay, lady?" "Want a
kerridge?" "Want a hack—hack—hack?" As for the gondoliers
themselves, how picturesque they look with their white
suits and colored scarfs! Who can resist the impulse to enter
one of these pretty barges and give oneself to the enjoyment
of the hour?

<p>
Few things are more delightful than floating here in a
gondola after the heat of a summer day. We say summer,
for Venice should, if possible, be always visited in warm
weather—the healthiest season here. Then only can one
thoroughly enjoy its outdoor life. However sultry it may be
on land, in Venice it is reasonably cool, and the broad bosom of
the Adriatic, as it swells
and falls, breathes
through the streets of
Venice the delicious
freshness of the sea.
At such a time, to idly
float upon this beautiful
expanse, dreaming
of art and history (perchance
of love), through
the sweet, tranquil
hours which bear upon
their noiseless wings
the hint of a repose still
held in the unfolded
hands of Night,—that
is happiness,—that is
rest! At such a time
one loves to call to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='Page_330' name='Page_330' href='#Page_330'>330</a></span>
mind the scenes which must have often taken place upon
the surface of this siren sea, when Venice had no less than
thirty thousand gondolas,
of which at least one-third
were richly decorated, and
vied with one another in
their gilded draperies and
carvings. To such an extent,
indeed, did reckless
competition in them go,
that the Doge finally issued
a decree that they should
thenceforth have black
awnings only. Since then
Venetian gondolas have
been prosaic in appearance,
though their dark awnings
have increased the opportunities
for crime or intrigue, and they have often been the
rendezvous of hate or love,—ideal vehicles for murder or
elopement.

To the lover of the beautiful in Nature the most enchanting

Italian sunsets are all beautiful; but those of Venice are the

were falling to the eastward; the hush of night was stealing
on the world. The cares of life seemed disappearing down
the radiant west together with the God of Day. Between us
and the setting sun there seemed to fall a shower of powdered
gold. The entire city was pervaded by a golden light, which
yet was perfectly transparent, like the purest ether.

As we drew nearer to the Grand Canal the scene grew even
more enchanting. In the refulgent light the city lay before
us like a beautiful mirage, enthroned upon a golden bank
between two seas,—the ocean and the sky. Her streets
seemed filled with liquid sunshine. The steps of her patrician
palaces appeared entangled in the meshes of a golden net.
The neighboring islands looked like jeweled wreckage floating
from a barge of gold. The whole effect was that of a poem
without words, illustrated by Titian, and having for a soft

accompaniment the ripple of the radiant waves. I have seen
many impressive sights in many climes; but for triumphant
beauty, crystallized in stone and glorified by the setting sun,
I can recall no scene more matchless in its loveliness than
that which I enjoyed, when, on this richly-tinted sea, I
watched the Bride and Sovereign of the Adriatic pass to the
curtained chamber of the night enveloped in a veil of gold.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
